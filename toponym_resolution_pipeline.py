### Assessment of NER

#The SemEvalâ€™13 introduced four different ways to measure precision/recall/f1-score results based on the metrics defined by MUC.

#Strict: exact boundary surface string match and entity type;

#Exact: exact boundary match over the surface string, regardless of the type;

#Partial: partial boundary match over the surface string, regardless of the type;

#Type: some overlap between the system tagged entity and the gold annotation is required;
