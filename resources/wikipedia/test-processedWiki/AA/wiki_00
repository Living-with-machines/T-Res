<doc id="68476019" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68476019" title="Franco Cozzo">
Franco Cozzo

Franco Cozzo (born 1936 in <a href="Ramacca">Ramacca</a>, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>) is a famous <a href="Italian-Australian">Italian-Australian</a> businessman. Arriving in Melbourne in 1955, Cozzo is best-known today for his pioneering TV advertisements which featured him speaking direct to customers in English, Greek, and his native Italian. However, he is perhaps most significant for producing Australia's first Italian-language TV show, "Carosello".

Although tastes in furniture have changed as years go by, Cozzo remains a cultural icon and as a prominent ethnic face on Australian television for over half a century, he has been one of the most visible proponents of multiculturalism in Victoria.

Section::::Biography.
Cozzo grew up with his family in Sicily, where his father was a horse trader. When he was 12, Cozzo's young sister died of a heart attack.

He migrated to Australia in 1955, at the age of 18, and Cozzo initially worked as a door-to-door salesman. He was working under the considerable handicap of being unable to speak more than a few words of English, however he soon learnt to identify the homes of Italians, Greeks, and other similar ethnic groups that were first making their way to Australia thanks to the post-war relaxation of the White Australia Policy that had previously restricted immigration to prevent most ethnic groups from outside the British isles from coming to the country.

Cozzo focused on this largely-ignored, but new and growing segment of the market. In his early days, Cozzo sold everything he could, not just the baroque furniture he is now largely associated with. His first shop in North Melbourne also sold whitegoods and for a brief time, he also had a Fiat dealership.

In the late 1960s, Cozzo produced a TV show featuring local Italian-Australian musical acts on <a href="ATV%20%28Australian%20TV%20station%29">Channel 0</a>, largely as an advertising vehicle for his furniture business. This was the first Australian TV show that was not broadcast in English, predating ethnic broadcasting on the government's <a href="Special%20Broadcasting%20Service">Special Broadcasting Service</a> by more than a decade. Around this time, he also purchased what would become his flagship store in Footscray.

By 1981, Cozzo's distinctive advertising of his Footscray store had raised the suburb's profile so much that the local council awarded him a plaque to recognise his contribution to the local community.

Cozzo divorced his first wife during the 1980s, before marrying again and having more children with his second wife. 

Cozzo's son, Luigi, was jailed in 1992 for drug trafficking. Luigi imported drugs by hiding them in his father's furniture shipments, this, combined with Cozzo's failure to update his styles to match changing tastes, has led to rumours that Luigi took the fall for his father.

Section::::Cultural impact.
Cozzo is a cultural icon in his adoptive home of Melbourne, and especially the suburb of Footscray, which he distinctively pronounces "Footisgray" in his TV ads. His distinctive Italian accent and trilingal ads set him apart from everything else on the Anglo-Australian television stations, and he was one of the most prominent ethnic TV personalities prior to the launch of the government-funded <a href="Special%20Broadcasting%20Service">Special Broadcasting Service</a>.

"Norda Melbin E Footisgray" by Tony Curiso was a stereotypically Italian tune with lyrics that are based on Cozzo's television advertisements. Recorded during his heights in the 1980s, the song highlighted the strength of Cozzo's brand, and even featured a special introduction recorded by the man himself.

The Argotiers 2020 song, "I Wanna Die in a Franco Cozzo Bed" is another song by a Melbourne artist that references the furniture magnate, or more specifically his wares. The song paints the picture of a bedroom furnished in the baroque style that made Cozzo millions.

Cozzo was the subject of "Palazzo di Cozzo" a biographical documentary film that examined his life and used his experiences as a Italian-Australian businessman from the 1950s to 2020s as a lens to view the changing acceptance of postwar southern European migrants to Australia which debuted at the 2021 <a href="Melbourne%20International%20Film%20Festival">Melbourne International Film Festival</a>.

"Bobby the Banana", an inanimate plush banana toy, was the first puppet, joining presenter <a href="Phillip%20Schofield">Phillip Schofield</a> for many of the in-vision links. Bobby the Banana was generally phased out and made way for the more expressive <a href="Gordon%20the%20Gopher">Gordon the Gopher</a>, a <a href="hand%20puppet">hand puppet</a> gopher operated, from under Schofield's continuity desk, by Paul Smith. As Gordon's personality - and costume, gaining a leather biker's jacket - grew, so did his popularity, leading to increasing <a href="screen%20time">screen time</a> interactions and 'story lines' with Schofield, and proved so popular that the character was giving his own line of various merchandise, which was branded "Gordon T. Gopher". When Schofield departed as host of The Broom Cupboard in 1987 to host the BBC's new Saturday morning programme "<a href="Going%20Live%21">Going Live!</a>", Gordon the Gopher went with him to the new series.

Schofield's replacement <a href="Andy%20Crane">Andy Crane</a> continued to host in much the same vein as Schofield and the format remaining unchanged. With Gordon the Gopher having left with Schofield, Crane quickly gained his own similarly mischievous side-kick in the form of <a href="Edd%20the%20Duck">Edd the Duck</a> - a plush duck hand puppet, operated similarly from under the control desk, by assistant producer Christina Mackay-Robinson (now Brown). Whereas Gordon the Gopher was mute, Edd communicated in quacks - of which Crane and guests seemed able to understand. Similarly to Gordon, Edd (originally spelled 'Ed')'s personality and costume swifty developed; originally appearing 'bald', several months in he gained a green woollen mohawk from a "<a href="Blue%20Peter">Blue Peter</a>" make, which became part of his trademark look; Edd's love for "Blue Peter", supposed "love" for its co-presenter <a href="Yvette%20Fielding">Yvette Fielding</a> and longing to become a "Blue Peter" presenter, all became regular fixture. Introduced a few months later was Wilson the Butler, only visible to viewers as a pair of white gloved arms in a black water's jacket appearing from the side of the screen, who became Edd's co-star and nemesis. As with the popularity of Gordon the Gopher, Edd the Duck similarly received his own line of merchandise. Andy Crane vacated the presenter's chair in 1990, moving to host programmes from rival "Children's ITV", and was replaced with <a href="Andi%20Peters">Andi Peters</a>, with Edd, Wilson and the overall Broom Cupboard format remaining identical.

With Peters in turn departed in 1993, the role of central host was filled by <a href="Toby%20Anstis">Toby Anstis</a>, who would remain with the "Children's BBC" strand after the Broom Cupboard setting was dropped as part of a significant shake-up of the format in 1996–7.

Since then, many different puppet sidekicks have been sued and the list below details many of those who have appeared on screen, either in CBBC continuity or programmes, over the last 35 years.

Tighina Fortress

Tighina Fortress (renamed by the Turks as Bender) is a 15th-century fortress on the right bank of the <a href="Dniester%20River">Dniester River</a> in <a href="Bender%2C%20Moldova">Bender</a>, Moldova, built from earth and wood during the reign of Prince <a href="Stephen%20the%20Great">Stephen the Great</a>. In 1538 it was conquered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkish</a> sultan <a href="Soliman%20the%20Magnificent">Soliman the Magnificent</a>, who ordered it to be rebuilt in stone and enlarged.

Section::::History.
The earliest mention of Tighina, as a settlement and customs post, is found in the commercial privilege granted on October 6, 1408, by the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince</a> of Moldavia <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Moldavia">Alexander the Good</a> to the merchants of <a href="Lviv">Lviv</a>. Later, throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the name of Tighina is frequently recorded in medieval documents. In the Moldavian documents that mention the locality, in Tighina, along with the royal customs and the crossing, a "guard" is mentioned. In the only document from the Prince <a href="Stephen%20the%20Great">Stephen the Great</a> (1457-1504) in which Tighina appears, the "guard" is also mentioned.

As for the "fortress" of Tighina, 19th-century researchers, following the information circulating in previous centuries, accredited the idea that it was built in the 12th century by the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a>, as well as <a href="Khotyn%20Fortress">Hotin</a> and <a href="Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi%20fortress">Cetatea Albă</a> fortresses. The military historian Aleksander Zaschuk saw in the architecture of the inner citadel a pronounced western character. The first and only definite mention of the existence of the Moldavian fortification itself, of the fortress (probably of wood and earth), is found in the "Moldavian-Polish Chronicle" from the middle of the 16th century. It relates, referring to the Ottoman conquests of 1538, that the Turkish sultan Süleyman "took possession of the Moldavian fortress Tighina."

Archaeological investigations of limited extent, carried out by the researcher <a href="Ion%20H%C3%AEncu">Ion Hîncu</a> in 1969, allowed the discovery of housing complexes and a defense ditch belonging to the 15th-16th centuries. Archaeological excavations have led to the identification of a fortification, probably of wood and earth, which preceded the later stone construction. The surface of the fortress' courtyard of circular or ovoid shape was covered with a layer of ashes. Ceramic and metal objects bear traces of fire.

<doc id="68476263" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68476263" title="H3 (Kuwait)">
H3 (Kuwait)

H3 (also H3, as-Sabiyah) is an <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> in the <a href="Subiya%2C%20Kuwait">Subiya Region</a> (<a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>) that was occupied during the second half of the sixth millennium BC. It belonged to the local Arabian Neolithic tradition and had extensive contacts with <a href="Ubaid%20period">Ubaid</a> settlements in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Among the finds at the site were a boat model and pieces of bitumen covered with reed impressions that may have come from an actual boat, making this among the earliest evidence of a sea-going vessel in the world.

Section::::The site and its environment.
H3 is located on Jazirat Dubaji, a low peninsula on the north side of <a href="Kuwait%20Bay">Kuwait Bay</a>. Originally, the site may have been located on the edge of a shallow lagoon, but today it is surrounded by mud flats. The site consists of a low mound with <a href="pottery">pottery</a> and <a href="flint">flint</a> scattered over the surface. Some architectural remains are visible on the surface as well. Its size has been estimated at 90 by 80 m.

Section::::History of research.
The site was initially identified by Fahad al-Wohaibi. A preliminary <a href="Survey%20%28archaeology%29">archaeological survey</a> and small-scale <a href="Archaeological%20excavation">excavation</a> were subsequently carried out. Full-scale excavation started in 1998 by a joint team of the British Archaeological Expedition to Kuwait and <a href="Kuwait%20National%20Museum">Kuwait National Museum</a>. Further excavation seasons were carried out between 1999 and 2004. The excavations were directed by Harriet Crawford.

Section::::Occupation history.
Based on the pottery, H3 has been dated to the Ubaid 2-3 period, or second half of the sixth millennium BC. A single <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon date</a> from the oldest part of the site provided a date of 5511-5324 cal BC. The oldest part of the site is thought to be a fire pit that was exposed in the western part of the site. The excavators interpret it as an installation where fish was processed. The main occupation at H3 consists of several separate stone-built structures, of which two were excavated and several more are visible on the surface. One was an open-air enclosure with a storage room. This area was probably used for the production of stone and flint tools.The second structure consisted of four rooms with <a href="Corbel">corbelled</a> walls, possibly to support a roof. The function of the rooms could not be determined with certainty, but based on the presence of certain artefacts and fish and mammal bones, one of the larger rooms was probably used as living area. Based on these substantial architectural remains, it has been suggested that the inhabitants may have lived for extended periods at the site - if not permanently.

The majority of the pottery at H3 consisted of plain and painted Ubaid ware. This pottery has been dated to Ubaid 2-3, with parallels found at sites like <a href="Choga%20Mami">Choga Mami</a> in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Dosariyah">Dosariyah</a> along the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Gulf</a> coast. Based on the abundant presence of fish bones and fishing equipments, <a href="fishing">fishing</a> must have been of considerable importance at the site. Fishing was practiced in shallow water, but there is evidence for deep-water fishing as well. Some of the species identified at H3, such as tuna, are no longer present in Kuway Bay today. <a href="Gazelle">Gazelle</a> and sheep/goat bones were also present, indicating that the occupants of H3 also practiced <a href="hunting">hunting</a> as well as <a href="pastoralism">pastoralism</a>. <a href="Date%20palm">Date stones</a> found at the site are among the earliest evidence in the world for date consumption, together with stones from <a href="Dalma%20%28island%29">Dalma Island</a> (UAE). The inhabitants of H3 also manufactured shell jewelry, possibly to be traded with other communities.

H3 has been interpreted as a settlement belonging to the local Arabian Neolithic tradition that practiced extensive contacts with the Ubaid settlements of Mesopotamia. These contacts may have involved trade, where Ubaid pottery, shells and pearls were commodities.

Section::::Seafaring.
H3 has provided intriguing evidence for seafaring. The first piece of evidence is a ceramic model depicting a <a href="Reed%20boat">reed-bundle boat</a>. Similar models have been found at <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamian</a> sites including <a href="Eridu">Eridu</a>, <a href="Tell%20el-%27Oueili">'Oueili</a> and <a href="Tell%20al-%27Ubaid">'Ubaid</a>, but the model from H3 is more detailed, for example with incisions that mimic the reed bundles from which the real boat would have been constructed. The second consists of a ceramic disc made from a sherd that appears to depict a reed bundle boat with two masts. This is the oldest evidence for the use of masts and sails. Finally, many pieces of <a href="Asphalt">bitumen</a> with <a href="Barnacle">barnacles</a> attached on one side and reed impressions on the other side were found at H3. The bitumen is interpreted as a waterproof coating that was applied to a reed-bundle boat. These pieces are the earliest evidence for actual boats in <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>, and the earliest evidence for seagoing vessels in the world. Geochemical analysis of the bitumen showed that it originated from a source in <a href="Burgan%20field">Burgan</a>, to the south of H3.

<doc id="68476276" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68476276" title="Partition Horrors Remembrance Day">
Partition Horrors Remembrance Day

Partition Horrors Remembrance Day is a national memorial day in <a href="India">India</a> on 14 August that commemorates the victims and sufferings of people during the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition of India</a>.

The day remembers the sufferings of many Indians during the partition. Several families were displaced and many lost their lives in the partition. It aims to remind Indians the need to remove social divisions, disharmony and to further strengthen the spirit of oneness, social harmony and human empowerment.

The partition had left 10 to 20 million people displaced and 2 to 3 million dead.<br>

Section::::Background.
The Partition was the division of <a href="British%20India">British India</a> into two independent <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s: <a href="Dominion%20of%20India">India</a> and <a href="Dominion%20of%20Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. The two states have since gone through further reorganization: the Dominion of India is today the <a href="India">Republic of India</a> (since 1950); while the Dominion of Pakistan was composed of what is known today as the <a href="Pakistan">Islamic Republic of Pakistan</a> (since 1956) and the <a href="Bangladesh">People's Republic of Bangladesh</a> (since 1971). The <a href="Partition%20%28politics%29">partition</a> involved the division of two provinces, <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> and <a href="Punjab%20Province%20%28British%20India%29">Punjab</a>, based on district-wide non-Muslim or <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> majorities. The partition also saw the division of the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Indian%20Navy">Royal Indian Navy</a>, the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service">Indian Civil Service</a>, the <a href="History%20of%20rail%20transport%20in%20India">railways</a>, and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the "<a href="Indian%20Independence%20Act%201947">Indian Independence Act 1947</a>" and resulted in the dissolution of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, i.e. Crown rule in India. The two self-governing independent Dominions of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 15 August 1947.

The partition displaced between 10 and 20 million people along religious lines, creating overwhelming <a href="Refugee%20crisis">refugee crises</a> in the newly constituted dominions. There was large-scale violence, with estimates of the loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20relations">their relationship</a> to this day.

Section::::Observance of Remembrance Day.
On 14 August 2021, Prime Minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a> declared that the 14 of August annually will be remembered as "Partition Horrors Remembrance Day" to remind the nation of the sufferings and sacrifices of Indians during the partition in 1947.

On 14 August 2021, Prime Minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a> said, "Partitions pains can never be forgotten. Millions of our sisters and brothers were displaced and many lost their lives due to mindless hate and violence.

Cook Islands National Museum

The Cook Islands National Museum is a museum in <a href="Avarua">Avarua</a> on <a href="Rarotonga">Rarotonga</a>, in the <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>. Its collection includes contemporary and historic artefacts, as well as replicas of objects in foreign institutions.

Section::::Background.
A purpose-built museum building was opened on 14 October 1992, in order to protect and encourage understanding of the cultural heritage of the Cook Islands. The museum had previously been housed in a section of the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20the%20Cook%20Islands">National Library</a>. The museum has a 200m² display space, as well as an office and store.

Section::::Exhibitions.
In 2019 the museum hosted an exhibition by Chinese micro-calligrapher <a href="Wang%20Zhiwen%20%28calligrapher%29">Wang Zhiwen</a>. Other exhibitions have included: on vaka voyaging history; on the contributions of Cook Islanders in the First World War; costumes from the 2018 <a href="Miss%20Cook%20Islands">Miss Cook Islands</a> pageant; photographs by <a href="Fe%27ena%20Syme-Buchanan">Fe'ena Syme-Buchanan</a> that highlight <a href="population%20decline">population decline</a> on <a href="Mangaia">Mangaia</a>; on <a href="Tivaevae">tivaivai</a> - a form of quilting specific to the Cook Islands; wooden sculpture from Pacific countries; as well as many others.

Section::::Collection.
The museum collection contains objects relating to the Cook Islands and other Pacific nations. In 1999 the collection comprised approximately 300 objects, mostly dating to after 1900. It includes archaeological material, including 800 year old fish hooks excavated from <a href="Moturakau">Moturakau</a>, <a href="Aitutaki">Aitutaki</a>. Similar objects, which remain the property of the museum, were excavated in 2003 from the motu <a href="Te%20Kainga">Te Kainga</a> of <a href="Rakahanga">Rakahanga</a>. Other objects in the museum's collection include ceremonial adzes, and a seven-foot long ceremonial spear. The collection also includes replica objects from a variety of islands. In 2020 the museum investigated whether it would be able to acquire a newly discovered sketch of Mangaia, painted by Captain Cook's surgeon.

Section::::Repatriation.
The Cook Islands National Museum has actively requested that 'smaller provincial collections in the UK consider repatriating Cook Island material'. In 1999 two necklaces were returned to the Cook Islands, following a request to <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus Council</a> by the museum. At the time, the council's decision was based on the view that the necklaces "had been donated at a time when the museum collected anything and everything from every corner of the globe, and neither has been on lengthy display in recent years". Writer and curator Neil G. W. Curtis described this example of repatriation, as Scottish "post-colonial empathy".

Section::::Adzes.
Adzes in particular were a popular item for early explorers, as well as later seamen and tourists to collect, so appear in many collections around the world. In 2017 several stone <a href="Adze">adzes</a> were returned to the Cook Islands from a private collection. They had been received as a gift by the former superintendent of <a href="Aitutaki%20Airport">Aitutaki Airfield</a>. The family returned to New Zealand, but felt that the objects should return to the Cook Islands.

Section::::Overseas collections.
Many museums around the world have collections which hold objects from the Cook Islands, including: tapa cloth held by <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>; adzes and tattooing instruments at the <a href="Wellcome%20Collection">Wellcome Collection</a>; many objects, including a cloak at <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Te Papa</a>; amongst others.

The film was filmed in black and white, despite the possibility of filming in color, due to the spread of color films at this time, due to the director Hussein Kamal's exploitation of black and white shades in a skill that would not have been possible if it had been filmed in color. The film was nominated for the <a href="Moscow%20International%20Film%20Festival">Moscow International Film Festival</a> best film award. The film is one of the <a href="Top%20100%20Egyptian%20films">Top 100 Egyptian films of the 20th century</a>.
Section::::Plot.
The story takes place in an Egyptian village where Atris (Mahmoud Morsi) imposes his authority on the people of the village and imposes royalties on them. Atris had been in love with Fouadah (Shadia) since his childhood, but Fouada challenges Atreus by opening the lock, which he closed as punishment for the villagers, and because Atris loves Fouadah, he cannot kill her, so he decides to marry her.

Hafez (Muhammad Tawfik) Fouada’s father cannot disobey the order of Atris, so he marries her to him with false witness testimony.

Because of this false marriage, Sheikh Ibrahim (Yehia Chahine) confronts Atris and kills Atris Mahmoud, the son of Sheikh Ibrahim.

The scene of the end comes with the scene of Mahmoud’s funeral, in which Sheikh Ibrahim repeats his famous sentence, “Atris’s marriage from Fouada is invalid.” All the people of the village repeat behind Sheikh Ibrahim, and they head to the house of Atris, who cannot resist all the people of the village together.


Section::::Production.
The film has a lot of symbolism, as Atris symbolizes the dictator, and the villagers symbolize the people who fall under the tyranny. Fouada symbolizes Egypt, which the dictator can not be happy with.

Some critics pointed out that this film may symbolize the period of <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser's</a> rule, and others pointed out that it may symbolize the period of <a href="Farouk%20of%20Egypt">King Farouk's</a> rule, as some said that it symbolizes any dictatorial rule, tyranny and oppression in general.

<a href="Hussein%20Kamal">Hussein Kamal</a> said: The enemies of success have spread a rumor to the effect that by Atris we mean President <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>.

A storm occurred and the film was ready to be shown, and its posters were filling the streets. <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> watched the film and watched it again with <a href="Anwar%20Sadat">Anwar Sadat</a>. After the second viewing, Gamal Abdel Nasser was convinced that it could not be the character of Atris and allowed the film to be shown.

Nikolai Sinebrychoff

Nikolai Sinebrychoff (, Nikolai Petrovich Sinebryukhov) (born ca. 1789 in <a href="Gavrilov%20Posad">Gavrilov Posad</a>, <a href="Empire%20of%20Russia">Empire of Russia</a> - died 23 January 1848 in <a href="Tver">Tver</a>, Empire of Russia) was a <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n businessman settled in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, who founded the <a href="Sinebrychoff">Sinebrychoff</a> brewery in 1809. He belonged to the <a href="Sinebrychoff%20family">Sinebrychoff family</a> which had a long history in Finland.

Section::::Life.
Petr Sinebrychoff, father of Nikolai Sinebrychoff, was originally a poor tenant farmer, who moved to <a href="Kymi%2C%20Finland">Kymi</a> in <a href="Old%20Finland">Old Finland</a> in the late 1790s and founded a <a href="brewery">brewery</a> to serve the <a href="Ruotsinsalmi%20sea%20fortress">Ruotsinsalmi sea fortress</a>. As his eldest son, Nikolai Sinebrychoff became the director of the brewery at age 16, when Petr Sinebrychoff died in 1805. The family business soon expanded to other areas. After the <a href="Finnish%20War">Finnish War</a>, Sinebrychoff moved the business activity from Ruotsinsalmi, which had become insignificant, to <a href="Suomenlinna">Suomenlinna</a> (then known as Viapori) near the city of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>. He was one of the official food merchants for the Russian garrison. In 1816 he won the right to sell <a href="rectified%20spirit">spirits</a>, <a href="beer">beer</a>, <a href="small%20beer">small beer</a> and <a href="sima%20%28mead%29">sima</a> to the Viapori soldiers, who had a great demand for them. He also sold food to the garrison in five shops and soon became rich.

In 1817 Sinebrychoff bought the lot of an old spirits factory in <a href="Ullanlinna">Ullanlinna</a>, Helsinki and acquired the right to manufacture and sell spirits, which he then regularly renewed up to his death. After buying a brewery in <a href="Vanhakaupunki">Vanhakaupunki</a> he acquired a monopoly for brewery activities in Helsinki in 1819. In the same year, he received permission to build a brewery on the lot south of <a href="Hietalahdentori">Hietalahdentori</a>. However, the activity was only moved there from Ullanlinna in 1829 when the new premises were completed. In 1842 a luxurious new main building was built in the brewery area, which currently houses the <a href="Sinebrychoff%20Art%20Museum">Sinebrychoff Art Museum</a>. In 1836, Sinebrychoff bought a three-hectare lot near the brewery, creating the <a href="Sinebrychoff%20park">Sinebrychoff park</a>. Sinebrychoff himself never moved to Helsinki, but instead lived in the house he had commissioned for himself in Viapori, which was later dismantled. He never learned either Swedish or Finnish but always conducted his business in Russian.

Sinebrychoff was also a significant renovator in Helsinki. By request from the state, he commissioned the <a href="Turku%20barracks">Turku barracks</a> in <a href="Kamppi">Kamppi</a> from 1830 to 1833. Sinebrychoff was awarded the title of commercial official in 1835. His business eventually expanded also to abroad. He died in 1848 of pneumonia on a business trip to Tver.

Section::::Legacy.
Nikolai Sinebrychoff never married or had children. After his death, his younger brothers <a href="Ivan%20Sinebrychoff">Ivan</a> and <a href="Pavel%20Sinebrychoff">Pavel Sinebrychoff</a> became the directors of the brewery, later joined by Pavel's children <a href="Nicolas%20Sinebrychoff">Nicolas</a> and <a href="Paul%20Sinebrychoff">Paul Sinebrychoff</a>, who also received the title of commercial official. The family grave is located at the <a href="Helsinki%20Orthodox%20cemetery">Helsinki Orthodox cemetery</a>.

In 1988 the Sinebrychoff brewery introduced the Nikolai Sinebrychoff beer to honour its founder.

What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?

"What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?" is the third episode of the <a href="What%20If...%3F%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="What%20If...%3F%20%28TV%20series%29">What If...?</a>", based on the <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> series <a href="What%20If%20%28comics%29">of the same name</a>. It explores what would happen if the events of the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> (MCU) <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%20tie-in%20comics">tie-in comic</a> "<a href="Fury%27s%20Big%20Week">Fury's Big Week</a>" (2012) occurred differently, with <a href="Nick%20Fury%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Nick Fury</a>'s campaign to recruit the <a href="Avengers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Avengers</a> derailed by a string of deaths. The episode was written by <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> <a href="A.C.%20Bradley%20%28screenwriter%29">A.C. Bradley</a> and story editor Matthew Chauncey, and directed by <a href="Bryan%20Andrews%20%28filmmaker%29">Bryan Andrews</a>.

<a href="Jeffrey%20Wright">Jeffrey Wright</a> narrates the series as the <a href="Watcher%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Watcher</a>, with this episode also starring the voices of <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L.

The series began development by September 2018, with Andrews and Bradley joining soon after, and many actors expected to reprise their roles from the MCU films; the events of "Fury's Big Week" are partially shown in the films "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20%28film%29">The Incredible Hulk</a>" (2008), "<a href="Iron%20Man%202">Iron Man 2</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Thor%20%28film%29">Thor</a>" (2011).

"What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?" was released on <a href="Disney%2B">Disney+</a> on August 25, 2021. Critics generally found the episode to be the weakest of the series' first three due to its less clear "what if?" scenario, although its darker storyline for an MCU project received praise. The episode's voice acting and connections to MCU films received mixed reviews.

Section::::Plot.
Over the course of a week, <a href="S.H.I.E.L.D.%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> director <a href="Nick%20Fury%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Nick Fury</a> attempts to recruit heroes for the <a href="Avengers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Avengers Initiative</a>, starting with <a href="Tony%20Stark%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Tony Stark</a>. Agent <a href="Natasha%20Romanoff%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Natasha Romanoff</a> gives Stark an injection to alleviate his palladium poisoning, but it proves fatal. S.H.I.E.L.D. detains Romanoff, but Fury helps her escape so she can find the killer. Meanwhile, <a href="Thor%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Thor</a> arrives on Earth and attempts to retrieve his hammer <a href="Mjolnir%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Mjolnir</a>, but is accidentally shot and killed by Agent <a href="Clint%20Barton%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Clint Barton</a>, who later dies in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

To analyze what killed Stark, Romanoff approaches Dr. <a href="Betty%20Ross%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Betty Ross</a>, who finds that a microscopic projectile was injected into Stark. Fury deduces that the killer is targeting his list of Avengers Initiative recruits, leaving Romanoff and <a href="Bruce%20Banner%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Bruce Banner</a> as the remaining targets. Romanoff discovers that Ross is hiding Banner just as Ross's father, General <a href="Thaddeus%20Ross%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Thaddeus Ross</a>, arrives to arrest them. Banner is shot and transforms into the Hulk, attacking General Ross's men before suddenly exploding.

<a href="Loki%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Loki</a> arrives on Earth with <a href="Asgard%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Asgard</a>'s army to avenge Thor's death, but Fury negotiates a temporary truce so that he can identify the killer. Romanoff discovers that someone used a deceased agent's profile to access S.H.I.E.L.D.'s network. She is subsequently murdered, though she manages to send a message to Fury revealing that the deaths are related to "hope". Fury realizes that Romanoff was referring to <a href="Hope%20van%20Dyne">Hope van Dyne</a>, who had died on a mission after Fury recruited her into S.H.I.E.L.D.

Fury proposes an alliance with Loki to catch the killer, and they confront Hope's father <a href="Hank%20Pym%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Hank Pym</a>, who built a "<a href="Yellowjacket%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29">Yellowjacket</a>" shrinking suit to commit the murders as a means of getting revenge against Fury. Loki defeats Pym, who is taken into Asgardian custody. Loki decides to stay on Earth and subjugate humanity, quickly becoming its ruler. Fury begins assembling more heroes, finding <a href="Steve%20Rogers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Steve Rogers</a> frozen in ice and summoning <a href="Carol%20Danvers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Carol Danvers</a> to Earth.

Section::::Production.
Section::::Development.
By September 2018, <a href="Marvel%20Studios">Marvel Studios</a> was developing an animated <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a> based on the "<a href="What%20If%20%28comics%29">What If...?</a>" comic books, which would explore how the <a href="List%20of%20Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%20films">Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films</a> would be altered if certain events occurred differently. <a href="Head%20writer">Head writer</a> <a href="A.C.%20Bradley%20%28screenwriter%29">A.C. Bradley</a> joined the project in October 2018, with director <a href="Bryan%20Andrews%20%28filmmaker%29">Bryan Andrews</a> meeting Marvel Studios executive <a href="Brad%20Winderbaum">Brad Winderbaum</a> about the project as early as 2018; Bradley and Andrews' involvement was announced in August 2019. They executive produce alongside Winderbaum, <a href="Kevin%20Feige">Kevin Feige</a>, <a href="Louis%20D%27Esposito">Louis D'Esposito</a>, and <a href="Victoria%20Alonso">Victoria Alonso</a>. Bradley and story editor Matthew Chauncey wrote the third episode, titled "What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?" It features an <a href="Parallel%20universes%20in%20fiction">alternate storyline</a> of the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%20tie-in%20comics">MCU tie-in comic</a> "<a href="Fury%27s%20Big%20Week">Fury's Big Week</a>" (2012), which covers a series of events that are partially shown in the films "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20%28film%29">The Incredible Hulk</a>" (2008), "<a href="Iron%20Man%202">Iron Man 2</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Thor%20%28film%29">Thor</a>" (2011). Moments from multiple other MCU films are also reimagined in the alternate storyline. "What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?" was released on <a href="Disney%2B">Disney+</a> on August 25, 2021.

Section::::Writing.
Winderbaum acknowledged that "Fury's Big Week" was an "obscure point of detail that only hardcore fans know", with Jake Kleinman at "<a href="Inverse%20%28website%29">Inverse</a>" opining that the interconnected nature of "The Incredible Hulk", "Iron Man 2", and "Thor" would likely be a new revelation for many viewers. Despite this, Marvel Studios was "very aware" of "Fury's Big Week" and suggested to Bradley early in development of the series that she should base an episode on it. Her initial pitch was for a comedic episode inspired by French <a href="farce">farce</a>, where "everything just keeps falling apart", but the creatives found the comedic tone to be a poor match for the events when they were breaking the story.

In the episode's alternate storyline, <a href="Nick%20Fury%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Nick Fury</a>'s campaign to recruit the <a href="Avengers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Avengers</a> is derailed by a string of deaths, becoming a murder mystery in the style of an <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a> story. Bradley explained that taking away Fury's plans for the Avengers Initiative gave him a "crisis of faith", making the character wonder if he was "ever on the right track? And what does he do next now that his greatest plan has turned to ashes?" This leads to the episode's night-time diner scene where Fury realizes that "the world needs the Avengers, and while he may have lost the first names on the list, there are other heroes out there". This scene had more material in the original script that was cut from the final episode.

The episode's premise was conceived "almost backwards", deciding on the outcome of the alternate storyline before determining the change to the MCU timeline that would cause it. For that, the writers had to work out who would be murdering the Avengers. After asking who would hate them enough in this time period to kill them, Winderbaum suggested <a href="Hank%20Pym%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Hank Pym</a> from "<a href="Ant-Man%20%28film%29">Ant-Man</a>" (2015) and "<a href="Ant-Man%20and%20the%20Wasp">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a>" (2018). Bradley agreed that Pym might do this if he lost his daughter, <a href="Hope%20van%20Dyne">Hope van Dyne</a>, since he would not "have been able to reconnect with his daughter by this point in the timeline. The loss of her, after the loss of his wife, it would have driven him over the edge." She developed the idea that Fury recruits Hope as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and then she dies on a mission. The episode suggests that van Dyne was sent on the <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> mission that <a href="Natasha%20Romanoff%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Natasha Romanoff</a> discusses in "" (2014). In that version, Romanoff survived being shot by the <a href="Bucky%20Barnes%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Winter Soldier</a>, but in this episode's version van Dyne is killed. In addition to altering the events of "Fury's Big Week" with Pym's revenge plot, these changes also lead to scenes from "<a href="The%20Avengers%20%282012%20film%29">The Avengers</a>" (2012) being reimagined in the episode.

Further discussing the episode, Kleinman felt revisiting the events of "The Incredible Hulk" in the episode helped to strengthen that film's connection to the MCU since it had "never really fit with the rest of the MCU tonally or stylistically". Eric Thomas at "DiscussingFilm" felt it was funny to discuss "The Incredible Hulk" as an MCU film due to the lack of references to it in later MCU projects, but Bradley did not feel this way as a fan of all MCU films and approached the episode's "Incredible Hulk" scenes the same way she did for the other MCU films. The writers wanted to pick iconic scenes from each of the "Fury's Big Week" films that audiences could easily recognize. Originally they wanted to feature the Harlem fight sequence from the end of "The Incredible Hulk", but eventually changed to the earlier Culver University fight scene because it worked better for their story.

This episode integrates Ruffalo's version of the character into alternate versions of scenes from that film, which Kleinman felt created "much cleaner continuity" between "The Incredible Hulk" and the rest of Banner's MCU story. Bradley had joked early in development that they should get Norton to reprise his role if Ruffalo was not available, but Ruffalo had already agreed to return for the series by then. New actors taking over from MCU stars in the episode include <a href="Lake%20Bell">Lake Bell</a> as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, replacing <a href="Scarlett%20Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>; <a href="Mick%20Wingert">Mick Wingert</a> as <a href="Tony%20Stark%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Tony Stark / Iron Man</a>, replacing <a href="Robert%20Downey%20Jr.">Robert Downey Jr.</a>; Stephanie Panisello as <a href="Betty%20Ross%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Betty Ross</a>, replacing <a href="Liv%20Tyler">Liv Tyler</a>; <a href="Michael%20Patrick%20McGill">Mike McGill</a> as <a href="Thaddeus%20Ross%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Thaddeus Ross</a>, replacing <a href="William%20Hurt">William Hurt</a>; and Alexandra Daniels as <a href="Carol%20Danvers%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29">Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel</a>, replacing <a href="Brie%20Larson">Brie Larson</a>. An uncredited actor voices Jack Rollins, replacing <a href="Callan%20Mulvey">Callan Mulvey</a>.

Section::::Animation.
Animation for the episode was provided by Squeeze, with <a href="Stephan%20Franck">Stephan Franck</a> serving as head of animation. Andrews developed the series' <a href="Cel%20shading">cel-shaded</a> animation style with Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios. Though the series has a consistent art style, elements such as the camera and color palette differ between episodes. Concept art for the episode is included during the end credits, and was released online by Marvel following the episode's premiere.

Section::::Music.
Composer <a href="Laura%20Karpman">Laura Karpman</a> combined elements of existing MCU scores with original music for the series, but chose to mostly write an original score for this episode rather than combining music from all the different films that the episode adapts. She likened her music to the <a href="Loki%20%28soundtrack%29">"Loki" soundtrack</a>, calling her score "whacky and modernist", with a new theme for the murder mystery storyline. A soundtrack for the episode was released digitally by <a href="Marvel%20Studios%23Marvel%20Music">Marvel Music</a> and <a href="Hollywood%20Records">Hollywood Records</a> on August 27, 2021, featuring Karpman's score.

Section::::Marketing.
On August 26, Marvel released a promotional poster for the episode featuring Nick Fury and a quote from the episode. After the episode's release, Marvel announced merchandise as part of its weekly "Marvel Must Haves" promotion for each episode of the series, including apparel and accessories based on the Watcher and various heroes.

Section::::Reception.
Kristen Howard, writing for "<a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>", found the episode to be an "enjoyably ridiculous, twisty <a href="whodunnit">whodunnit</a>" that was "a classic "What If...?" tale [using] a very silly twist to showcase just how bad everything could have been". She was shocked by the deaths of the Avengers, enjoyed Coulson's dialogue as well as the reveal of Pym as Yellowjacket, and gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars. Tom Jorgensen at "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" gave it a 7 out of 10 and was surprised to see a murder mystery in the MCU. He called it "Marvel's darkest divergence from canon yet" and found the deaths of Stark, Hulk, and Thor to be "surprisingly grim" but also believable since they used the struggles each hero was facing. He thought the episode needed more time and focus to best tell its mystery, but was positive about the reveal that Pym is the killer because he saw it as a logical progression from the character's depiction in "Ant-Man". Jorgensen had mixed feelings about the voice acting, praising Jackson's "remarkably consistent" Fury and describing Wingert's Tony Stark as "perfectly serviceable", but questioning why Bell's recognizable voice was chosen over an actress who sounded closer to Johansson. He also felt Romanoff's characterization was more humorous than it was in the films, and likened Gregg's performance more to his appearance in the 1995-set "<a href="Captain%20Marvel%20%28film%29">Captain Marvel</a>" (2019) than his Phase One appearances. Matt Goldberg at "<a href="Collider%20%28website%29">Collider</a>" was relieved that the episode did not simply swap one character for another like the first two, and praised its "darkly comic tone" that played with the audience's expectations.

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="Alan%20Sepinwall">Alan Sepinwall</a> found the episode to be less exciting than the first two episodes, both because it was an alternate storyline for "lesser MCU movies" and because the premise had a less clear "what if" scenario. Despite this, he was impressed by the episode's scale and thought the time with Fury "never feels wasted", adding that of the first three episodes this one felt the most like the "What If" comics. Angie Han of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" felt the episode had "less to offer in the way of emotional or thematic depth, and [could not] even scrape together a satisfying solution to the mystery it presents". "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>"s Sam Barsanti was even more critical of the episode, giving it a "C+" and believing it was the weakest so far with "the loosest 'what if' premise". He was unaware that the "Fury's Big Week" premise already existed before this episode and had trouble believing that the events of "The Incredible Hulk" occurred during the same week as "Iron Man 2" and "Thor". He also described many of the episode's "whodunnit?" elements as "silly silly" rather than just "What If...?" silly', and felt they distracted from the story. Revealing the episode was centered on Hope van Dyne was "where it really started crumble" for Barsanti, though he did enjoy everything after Pym is revealed to be the killer, including Douglas's performance, "Loki being Loki", and the tease of a future story with Captain America and Captain Marvel.

Like Barsanti, Adam Rosenberg at "<a href="Mashable">Mashable</a>" was also unaware of "Fury's Big Week" and discovered the comic after watching the episode. He questioned why the series would adapt the relatively-unknown comic when the first two episodes had focused on popular films, stating, "A cynic would tell you Marvel probably did it to drum up sales of [the comic]. A realist would say "Fury's Big Week" is simply a really cool and fun platform for a "What If...?" story". However, Rosenberg suggested that there was another intention from Marvel for featuring this story in the series, and began theorizing what this could mean in terms of the wider MCU and multiverse. Ethan Anderton at "<a href="/Film">/Film</a>" believed the episode set up "some kind of epic culmination that will presumably create a narrative tie between the episodes", shifting away from the series' anthology, individual episode format.

The Court of Chancery of Upper Canada was a <a href="court%20of%20equity">court of equity</a> in <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>. It was established in 1837. 

The idea of introducing a court of equity in the province had been around since at least 1801, when <a href="Henry%20Allcock">Henry Allcock</a> suggested it. On Allcock's model, <a href="Peter%20Hunter">Peter Hunter</a>—then the province's <a href="Lieutenant%20governor%20%28Canada%29">lieutenant governor</a>—would be the <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> and a <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">master of the rolls</a> would also be named. Allcock's proposal did not come to fruition: Hunter died and Allcock was named the chief justice of <a href="Lower%20Canada">Lower Canada</a> before the new court could be created. Various proposals were floated and also failed between 1801 and 1836.

On March 4, 1837, the <a href="parliament%20of%20Upper%20Canada">parliament of Upper Canada</a> finally created the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada by the "Chancery Act, 1837". The statute provided the court would "have jurisdiction, and possess the like power and authority as by the laws of England are possessed by the Court of Chancery in England, in respect of the matters hereinafter enumerated".

<doc id="68476925" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68476925" title="Athenebrunnen">
Athenebrunnen

The Athenebrunnen (or Fountain of Pallas Athena) is a fountain that bears the name of the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek goddess</a> <a href="Athena">Athena</a> and is along Jean-Amery-Weg towards <a href="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> in the western part of <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. It is a creation of (1870–1941), dating from 1911. This fountain, important both culturally and historically, has been fully operational since 2011.

Section::::Story.
The fountain belonged to the park of the villa built in 1870 by the industrialist (1840–1905). His widow Julie had the fountain built by sculptor Karl Donndorf on the northern slope of Karlshöhe in a neoclassical style. It was located in the park above the Villa Siegle which is at the foot of Karlshöhe, and below the family's summer house "Sonnenschlösschen", which was at the top.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the whole park suffered much damage. The villa had been destroyed in 1944 and the ruins demolished in 1953. The summer house was also demolished in 1961 and replaced by a viewing terrace with a bar which still exists today. Athena's fountain had also fallen into disrepair. In 1989, the Cultural Association , which owns a large part of Karlshöhe, had the basins and figures of the fountains restored.

A notice-board next to the fountain reads: "For the 150th anniversary in 2011, the cultural association Verschönerungsverein Stuttgart restored the statues of Athena, Pandora, Prometheus, the head of Zeus and the system of fountains." The fountain has been functioning normally since then.

Section::::Appearance.
In the center of the neoclassical fountain dominates the statue of the goddess Athena at the moment of her birth. According to Greek mythology – <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>" (886–900) – she emerged from the head of her father <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> in full armor. The stone statue of Athena wears a metal shield, spear, armor and helmet. Only the head of Zeus appears; this serves as a pedestal for the statue of the goddess.

Below the statue of Athena and the head of Zeus, two well basins lie like a staircase. Next to the lower basin, the stone figure of <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a> can be seen on the right hand of Athena. On her left is the figure of <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a> with the famous box on her lap.

Section::::Symbolism.
The choice of the goddess Athena reflects how the Siegle family liked to see themselves. Athena is the protector of the city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> but moreover she is considered the goddess of wisdom and the patroness of the arts and sciences. Gustav and Julie Siegle were also generous supporters of cultural, social and scientific purposes. Not only was the first hospital (1893) in <a href="Stuttgart-Feuerbach">Feuerbach</a> theirs, but also the <a href="Gustav-Siegle-Haus">Gustav-Siegle-Haus</a> in Stuttgart in 1912, which was used for popular education.

Moreover, the system of fountains symbolizes the dual value of all human striving for knowledge. According to Greek mythology, Prometheus brought fire to men and was cruelly punished for his act by Zeus. On the other hand, Pandora brought all the evils to humanity by leaving them only hope.

Three years later, in 1914, Karl Donndorf undertook another work in Stuttgart on the ambivalence of good and bad with the (Fountain of Destiny), composed of the <a href="Moirai">Goddess of Fate</a> in the center of a semicircle, on the left the statue of the allegory of pain, on the right the statue of the allegory of joy and love.

Prestwick Burgh Hall

Prestwick Burgh Hall, also known as Prestwick Freeman's Hall and Prestwick Freemen's Hall, is a municipal building in Kirk Street, <a href="Prestwick">Prestwick</a>, Scotland. The structure, which served as the meeting place of Prestwick Burgh Council, is a Category B <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

Section::::History.
The first municipal building in Prestwick was an early 18th century <a href="tolbooth">tolbooth</a>. The tolbooth was used as the offices and meeting place of the chancellor and the two bailies who administered the town: they were elected annually by the 36 freemen of the burgh who owned of land in and around the town. The current building was commissioned by the freemen of Prestwick for use as the local burgh school. It was designed in the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival style</a>, built in <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> stone and was completed in 1837.

The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto the corner of The Cross and Kirk Street; the central bay, which projected forward, featured a porch with an arched doorway and an <a href="octagon">octagon</a>al tower above. The tower was fenestrated with a <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a> on the first floor and featured a clock face in the stage above which was surmounted by a <a href="spire">spire</a>. There were lancet windows in the outer bays. The ground floor was initially used as a prison and the first floor was used by the burgh school which accommodated some 60 children.

By the late 19th century the burgh council had assumed most of the functions of the freemen and the building had become the burgh hall. It continued in that use until the burgh council established the municipal buildings in Links Road in the late 1930s. The former burgh hall was then acquired by Ayrshire County Council and became their local district offices.

After the steeple was found to be structurally unsound, it was removed in 2011: a firm of consultants advised that it should be rebuilt using new masonry and that the original stone should be used as template. Although residents lobbied for it to be restored <a href="South%20Ayrshire%20Council">South Ayrshire Council</a> failed to attract support from the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, or any other charitable source, to carry out the necessary works.

Angel Solakov

Angel Ivanov Solakov (; 22 July 1922 – 1998) was a <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n Communist politician and statesman who served as the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Bulgaria%29">Minister of Interior</a> and chairman of the <a href="Committee%20for%20State%20Security%20%28Bulgaria%29">Committee for State Security</a>.

Section::::Biography.
Solakov was born in Sofia and joined the <a href="Workers%20Youth%20League%20%28Bulgaria%29">Workers' Youth League</a> at the age of 16 in 1938 and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">Bulgarian Communist Party</a> in 1942.

During the war, Solakov led communist partisan detachments against the regime. He was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Solakov was released in 1944 after the liberation of Bulgaria from occupying German troops. 

Solakov was active in the <a href="Dimitrov%20Communist%20Youth%20Union">Dimitrov Communist Youth Union</a> and was secretary of the Central Committee of the union from 1951 to 1958. After power was solidified in the hands of <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">Todor Zhivkov</a>, Solakov quickly rose in the hierarchy of the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgarian People's Republic</a>. He was co-opted into the Central Committee of the BCP and was appointed deputy Interior Minister.

In 1965 he took an active part in the suppression of the 1965 coup d'état attempt, after which the dictator Zhivkov made him chairman of the State Security Committee, separated from the Ministry of Interior, and after the KDS was merged with the Ministry in 1968, he received the rank of minister.

In the 1971 he started to fall out of favor with the BCP leadership, particularly Zhivkov himself and subsequently he was removed from his office. One reason for the removal was Solakov's involvement in football conflicts. Solakov pointedly gave preference to <a href="Levski-Spartak%20Sofia">FC Levski-Spartak</a> and allegedly was involved in creating hooligan groups for the club. Another reason was Zhivkov's concern was that the Ministry of Interior was becoming too powerful under Solakov and its increasing surveillance over party officials. 

Another possible reason was his conflicts with Soviet officials: as an historian, Solakov stated in such contacts that in the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">Russian-Turkish</a> and World War II the Bulgarian people liberated themselves primarily on their own, while the support of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union played a secondary role. The worst of these conflicts happened during a toast with general <a href="Semyon%20Tsvigun">Semyon Tsvigun</a>. 

Solakov criticized himself, emphasized his personal loyalty to Zhivkov, and agreed to be removed from the government. Zhivkov accepted the apologies and the case ended with the removal of Angel Solakov from the ministry and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. 

Angel Solakov became the Chairman of the Bulgarian Rowing Federation in 1963 and from 1971 to 1990 he was the Deputy Chairman of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Olympic%20Committee">Bulgarian Olympic Committee</a>.

Conversational scoreboard

In <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> and <a href="philosophy%20of%20language">philosophy of language</a>, the conversational scoreboard is a <a href="tuple%20%28mathematics%29">tuple</a> which represents the <a href="context%20%28language%20use%29">discourse context</a> at a given point in a <a href="conversation">conversation</a>. The scoreboard is updated by each <a href="speech%20act">speech act</a> performed by one of the interlocutors.

Most theories of conversational scorekeeping take one of the scoreboard's elements to be a <a href="common%20ground%20%28linguistics%29">common ground</a>, which represents the <a href="proposition">propositional</a> information mutually agreed upon by the interlocutors. When an interlocutor makes a successful assertion, its content is added to the common ground. Once in the common ground, that information can then be <a href="presupposition">presupposed</a> by future utterances. Depending on the particular theory of scorekeeping, additional elements of the scoreboard may include a <a href="Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29">stack</a> of <a href="question%20under%20discussion">questions under discussion</a>, a list of <a href="discourse%20referent">discourse referent</a>s available for <a href="anaphora%20%28linguistics%29">anaphora</a>, among other categories of contextual information.

The notion of a conversational scoreboard was introduced by <a href="David%20Lewis%20%28philosopher%29">David Lewis</a> in his most-cited paper "Scorekeeping in a Language Game". In the paper, Lewis draws an analogy between conversation and <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, where the scoreboard tracks categories of information such as strikes, outs, and runs, thereby defining the current state of the game and thereby determining which future moves are licit.

Iossif Aronovich Spinel. ⁠() (September 25 (7 October)1892, White Church, now the Kiev oblast of the Ukraine — 2 July 1980, Moscow) was a Russian painter, <a href="graphic%20artist">graphic artist</a> and <a href="scenic%20designer">scenic designer</a> of more than 60 films including <a href="Ivan%20the%20Terrible%20%281944%20film%29">Ivan the Terrible</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Nevsky%20%28film%29">Alexander Nevsky</a> by <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>.

Born as the eighth child in the poor Jewish family of a teacher in Belaya Tserkov (Ukraine), he survived several pogroms. 
First in Kiev, then in Moscow, he studied architecture. Then he continued his education in <a href="Vkhutemas">Vkhutemas (Higher Art and Technical Studios)</a> with the great master of graphic design <a href="Vladimir%20Favorsky">Vladimir Favorsky</a>.

As a graphic artist he had illustrated several books in the 1920s, where modernist graphic design was used:

To illustrate Gastev’s ideas, Iosif Shpinel’ created a series of sketches in the suprematist and constructivist styles that accentuated this approach to the “education of the body as a working machine”.

Shpinel’s artistic education took place in one of the prominent centres of Soviet avant-garde art and architecture: from 1921 to 1926, he studied in the architecture department of the Higher Art and Technical Workshops in Moscow (VKhUTEMAS). Later he worked as a set designer with such prominent film directors as Aleksandr Dovzhenko (The Arsenal, 1929, and Ivan, 1932), Mikhail Romm (Boule de Suif, 1934), and Sergei Eisenstein (Alexander Nevskyi, 1938, and Ivan the Terrible, 1944–6).

His illustrations for Youth, Go! convey an image of the body reduced to a number of basic geometric shapes – circles, triangles, rectangles; a body devoid of symmetry and naturalness, and instead resembling a mannequin with limbs suspended on spherical joints and body parts freely detachable one from another. ... In Youth, Go!, the anatomy of the human hand is followed by the anatomy of an axe, insofar as both are part of a single whole: the new socialist working class.

As a major film artist and architect, he was renowned for his ingenuity:

The film director Grigori Roshal wrote in his memoirs:

He has taught since 1928, since 1940 at the Art Faculty of the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography <a href="Gerasimov%20Institute%20of%20Cinematography">VGIK</a>, where he became a professor in 1965. His students became leading set designers at Soviet film studies.

The book about his life and work "Iossif Spinel: The Artist's Way" by Tamara Tarasova-Krasina was published by Iskusstvo Publishing House Moscow in 1979

As if the glow of a dark and stormy era lies on the whole atmosphere of Eisenstein's film "Ivan the Terrible" - on the heavy vaults and galleries of the palace, on the cathedral frescoes lit by the anxious flame of candles. Spinel's work in this film helps us to feel the time with all its contradictions, enhances the tragic tension of dramaturgical conflicts."(Translation from Russian)"

Imo Awka festival

Imo Awka festival (Imo Oka or Imoka festival) is an ancient cultural event that is celebrated annually by the people of <a href="Awka">Awka</a> kingdom in the month of May in order to venerate their gods. Imo-Oka shrine is symbolic and it is denoted by the special white-bellied monkey, widely respected and revered as the messengers of the shrine.

The <a href="festival">festival</a> is basically celebrated to appreciate the Imoka god, for her favours and to request for much better years ahead. The festival allows for the people of Awka to look inward and thank the Imoka god for shielding them from external invasion and to pray for peace and prosperity of the town.

Section::::History.
The Imo Awka festival emanated from the worship of the greatest male god revered in Awka, known to be Imoka deity. The Imo Awka festival could be traced back to ancient times during the times Awka people were always attacked and threatened by their neighbours. One of their terrifying oppressor was King Okoli Ijeoma of Ndikelionwu, who planned to attack their land. On getting to know about the planned invasion by King Okoli, the elders of the land sent out delegates to Akoto, a land known to be full of potent herbal doctors, to invite one of them who would develop a charm that would fortify the Awka warriors.
They returned with a renowned herbal doctor by name Okoyeke. He prepared the charm to fortify their warriors but warned them that the charm must be venerated by the community to become effective. The Imoka is described as a protective medicine that aid them to fight their enemies. <a href="Monkey">Monkeys</a> were dedicated to the Imoka deity because when <a href="Nawfia">Nwafia</a> people laid siege to attack the people of Awka, the Imoka gods sent his emissaries the monkeys in the forest to inform them of attack. They sense the danger and repelled the attack and defeated their enemies. Hence it became a taboo to kill or eat the meat of monkeys till date with severe consequences.

All these events resulted to the worship of the CHARM-god Imoka( the Avenger god of Awka people). Therefore the Imo Awka festival was initiated to commensurate the worship.

Section::::Festivity.
The Imo Awka festival is a two weeks events that commence with the females paying homage to Imoka, dancing the Opu Eke dance. The first day of the festival is always on Avbo (Afor) market day and on the evening of the Oye market day preceding the feast, the trumpet was blown, the Abia drum beaten and Ikolo Imoka sounded to marshal in Egwu Imoka. 

The festival features four major events, the Ede-Mmuo, Ogwu Oghugha, Eqwu Opu-Eke and Egwu Imo-Oka. The Imo Awka festival showcases several kinds of masquerades that displays at the Imoka shrine. In 2019, it was observed that masquerades that has never been featured before were there which added more liveliness to the festival.

There is an interesting part of the festival that features beating of canes called Nro-Nta between two male groups. They simply flog themselves until one refuses to beat back and surrenders. This mock battle is usually beating male folks but the female folk could watch. The essence of the battle is to test one's strength and endurance of pain. The festival concludes with visiting the Imo-Oka stream on the final day which is heralded by a heavy downpour of rain that falls in the late afternoon. In 2020, the festival was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic and the ban on social gatherings by the World Health Organisation and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.

In 1987, the Art Gallery of Windsor organized the circulating exhibition "Caven Atkins : the Winnipeg years" curated by Ted Fraser.

His work is included in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Canada">National Gallery of Canada</a>, the Canadian War Museum, the Art Gallery of Algoma, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a>, the Art Gallery of Windsor (56 works) the <a href="Beaverbrook%20Art%20Gallery">Beaverbrook Art Gallery</a>, Fredericton and the <a href="Remai%20Modern">Remai Modern</a> , Saskatoon.

Soetitah

Soetitah (born circa 1890, date of death unknown) was a <a href="Sarekat%20Islam">Sarekat Islam</a> and <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a> (PKI) propagandist, activist, and schoolteacher in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in the 1910s and 1920s. She was a close ally of <a href="Semaun">Semaun</a>, <a href="Tan%20Malaka">Tan Malaka</a>, and other Semarang communists of the time and was chair of the women's section of the party in the early 1920s. She was exiled by the Dutch to the <a href="Boven-Digoel%20concentration%20camp">Boven-Digoel concentration camp</a> from 1927 to 1930.

Section::::Biography.
Soetitah was born in <a href="Semarang">Semarang</a>, <a href="Central%20Java">Central Java</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in around 1890. Little is known about her early life or family background. 

She became involved in the <a href="Sarekat%20Islam">Sarekat Islam</a> and radical politics during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>; she later described herself as having come from very poor and desperate circumstances and having been inspired by <a href="Semaun">Semaun</a>. By 1919 she was leading mass gatherings of thousands of Semarang SI members and helping organize a new division of that organization specifically for women. The Semarang branch of the was far more leftist than most of that organization. She was president of the women's section of that branch by 1920, with one of her close allies <a href="Moenasiah">Moenasiah</a>, a <a href="Warung">Warung</a> operator from Semarang, as vice-president.

<a href="Tan%20Malaka">Tan Malaka</a>, a prominent Indonesian communist at the time, supported the expansion of independent leftist schools and for the creation of women's factions in the communist movement. After Tan Malaka was exiled from the Indies in the spring of 1922, she spoke up in his defense and stated that the Indies needed a mass organization for native women. In 1923 the Semarang branch of the distanced itself increasingly from the central body of the organization in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> (led by <a href="H.%20O.%20S.%20Tjokroaminoto">H. O. S. Tjokroaminoto</a> and reorganized itself more explicitly as the Indonesian Communist Party; her ally Moenasiah became vice-chair of the women's section of the new party. And later in 1923 when there were mass arrests of Semarang SI/PKI leaders, including <a href="Semaun">Semaun</a>, she spoke out passionately and advocated for a strike of the communist-affiliated tramway personnel. Because of that speech, she and other members of the women's committee (Moenasiah and Napsiah) were also arrested, although they were released after a short time.

However, many members remained in the SI and the Semarang branch continued to exist until 1925, when it renamed itself (people's union), this time with Moenasiah as chair and Soetitah as vice-chair of the women's section. They also held similar roles in the women's section of the Communist Party itself during this period where <a href="Aliarcham">Aliarcham</a> was the key party leader. The , like the SI, had its own system of independent schools and Soetitah was involved in recruitment and teaching in them. 
In February 1927 she was detained in the mass arrests of Communist Party activists and leaders which took place across Java. She was exiled to <a href="Boven-Digoel%20concentration%20camp">Boven-Digoel concentration camp</a> along with roughly a thousand other PKI members who were detained there indefinitely without charge. Relatively few women activists were arrested and exiled there; among these were activists and educators including not only Soetitah and Moenasiah in Semarang but also Soekaesih and Saama, two activists in the women's division of the organization in Batavia. On the other hand, many women ended up travelling their and living with their interned husbands during the late 1920s and 1930s. One estimate from early 1928 stated that, out of 823 people interned at the Tanah-Merah camp in Digoel, only 15 were women, but another 231 women had traveled there to live with their interned husbands.

She was released from her internment in Boven-Digoel in December 1930 along with a large group of 144 detainees. After her release it is unclear where she went or whether she remained politically active.

<doc id="68478238" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68478238" title="James Hannay (minister)">
James Hannay (minister)

James Hannay (c.1595 – 1661) was a Scottish clergyman who served as Dean of <a href="St%20Giles%20Cathedral">St Giles Cathedral</a>. He is best remembered as the unfortunate clergyman struck on the head by a stool thrown by <a href="Jenny%20Geddes">Jenny Geddes</a> after reading from the English <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>.

Section::::Life.
He was born in the <a href="Canongate">Canongate</a> district of <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> the son of John Hannay (d.1604) a bailie and burgess, and his second wife Maus Smyth. John had been an MP in Wigtownshire. John's father was Patrick Hannay of <a href="Sorbie">Sorbie</a>.

He studied at <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a> gaining an MA in 1615. He became minister of <a href="Kilmaurs">Kilmaurs</a> in <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a> in 1620, and was translated to his home parish of Canongate in 1624. However, this predated the building of <a href="Canongate%20Kirk">Canongate Kirk</a>. The church at this time was continuing to worship in <a href="Holyrood%20Abbey">Holyrood Abbey</a>.

At this time therefore the parish church was still connected to <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood Palace</a>. In 1633 it was Hannay who performed the "coronation" of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> in <a href="Holyrood%20Abbey">Holyrood Abbey</a>. This symbolic ceremony (Charles had been king for 8 years) apparently partly rebuilt missing elements of the Abbey to make it look appropriate for this regal function. Probably through this royal connection it was Charles I himself who presented Hannay to Edinburgh Town Council, twice in 1634, for the role of Dean of <a href="St%20Giles%20Cathedral">St Giles</a>. The Council accepted this and presented him in March 1635 and he began the role of Dean in April 1635.

In the summer of 1635 Hannay went (with other senior Scottish clergy) to London to draft the <a href="Scottish%20Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Scottish Book of Common Prayer</a>. In May 1637 King Charles granted Hannay estates in <a href="Kelso%2C%20Scottish%20Borders">Kelso</a> for his work on this. Hannay was inevitably a supporter of the Book of Common Prayer.

It is an incident on Sunday 23 July 1637 which places Hannay into the national understanding of the history of the Scottish Church. He was equipped with a new Edinburgh publishing by the King's official printer, Robert Young, fresh off the press: the Scottish <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>. This had been commissioned by <a href="Archbishop%20Laud">Archbishop Laud</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Whilst modern eyes (or ears) might not appreciate the fury this incited, the core issue was the book (whilst being a "Scottish" version) was still intrinsically English. The service began with three prayers led by Rev Patrick Henderson from the uncontroversial <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Order">Book of Common Order</a>. As he finished he said he did not think he would be reading ever again. Hannay then took the Scottish Book of Common Prayer to the <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> (at around 10am). The use of an English rather than Scottish <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> was offensive, and had also sidestepped the control of the presbyteries. Many also saw it as a move back to the <a href="Catholic%20mass">Catholic mass</a>. <a href="David%20Lindsay%20%28bishop%20of%20Edinburgh%29">Bishop Lindsay</a> was close to Hannay in his <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> when the reading sparked a widespread riot in the church. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">Bishop of St Andrews</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</a> were also present. Infamously <a href="Jenny%20Geddes">Jenny Geddes</a> stood up and threw her stool at Hannay's head. Bishop Lindsay had moved to the pulpit to quell the crowd but was pulled out by a Mrs Main. The service had to be terminated. The demonstrators (most of the congregation) were ejected, but remained outside. This incident was a precursor to the <a href="National%20Covenant">National Covenant</a> of 1638.

In April 1638 Hannay was one of three senior ministers who met the Bishops of Edinburgh, Dunblane and Argyll to discuss the way forward. Hannay's position was becoming more and more out of tune with the wider population. In 1639 Hannay was deposed for reading and defending the new service book and refusing the orders of the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly</a>.

His activities from 1639 to 1661 are unknown.

He died in June 1661. At the Restoration, and the return of a King to the throne (Charles II), his children were granted a pension, reflecting Hannay's continued Royalist support.

Section::::Family.
He married Isobel Brown (d.1674) who was buried in the <a href="Holyrood%20Abbey">Kirk of Holyrood House</a>.

They had at least seven children:

Section::::Memorials.
A brass plaque to Hannay was erected in St Giles Cathedral in the late 19th century.

Fifth Ward Democrats

The Fifth Ward Democrats were a short-lived semi-professional <a href="American%20football">American football</a> team that played one season in the <a href="Wilmington%20Football%20League">Wilmington Football Association</a>. The team played five games before forfeiting their franchise in mid-November. The team was based in <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>.
Section::::History.
In September 1933, the <a href="Wilmington%20Football%20Association">Wilmington Football Association</a> announced the additions of two teams for the 1933 season: the Fifth Ward Democrats, and <a href="Ninth%20Ward%20Ducks">Ninth Ward Ducks</a>. The Ducks had previously been a league member while Fifth Ward was new. The league arranged the Democrats' first game to be against the <a href="Eleventh%20Ward%20Whitejackets">Eleventh Ward Whitejackets</a>, who had won the championship for the past two seasons. The game, scheduled for October 1 at <a href="Lattimer%20Field">Lattimer Field</a>, ended in a 0–26 defeat. "<a href="The%20News%20Journal">The Morning News</a>" wrote, "Approximately 3500 fans witnessed the game at the Whitejacket's new field and were well pleased with the orderly manner in which the game was conducted. The Fifth Ward eleven while boasting a strong eleven, the starting lineup containing several <a href="Penn-Del%20Athletic%20Association">Penn-Del</a> players, showed the need for more practice, and if this fault is overcome the Taylor outfit should give the rest of the clubs a merry chase for title honors."

The team's next matchup was against the <a href="Defiance%20Bulldogs">Defiance Bulldogs</a>, the oldest member of the league as well as two-time champion. Fifth ward was able to tie the Bulldogs 7–7, due to a late 95-yard interception return to tie the game in the fourth quarter. A game recap by "The Morning News" said, "In a hard-fought battle at Talleyville yesterday, Defiance and Fifth Ward Democrats battled to a 7 to 7 deadlock in their Wilmington Football Association game." Defiance led from the second quarter (on a touchdown by Haley) to the fourth, before Taggart, of Fifth Ward, returned a Defiance pass 95 yards to tie the game. The tie put them fourth of six in the league's standings.

Fifth Ward would move one place down in the standings following their week three game against the <a href="Delaware%20Panthers">Delaware Panthers</a>. The Panthers "smothered" Fifth Ward, shutting them out 0–65. The game was played at <a href="Panther%20Field%20%28Delaware%29">Panther Field</a> on October 15. The next week would also be a shutout, losing 0–26 versus the Ninth Ward Ducks on the same venue. The loss moved them down to last place in the league, sharing the position with the <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Cats">St. Mary's Cats</a>. The team's next scheduled game, against the last-place St. Mary's, was postponed as both teams were eliminated from the first-half title race and desired to rest to prepare for the second half.

An October 30 article by "The Morning News" wrote, "The Democratic Club, with the addition of several new players, expect to give a good account of themselves in the second half." The team's first second half game was the same as the first, against the Eleventh Ward Whitejackets, who had just won their third consecutive league title. The game, played in Lattimer field again, finished with a 0–13 loss. The next game was against Defiance, at Krebbs Field. Fifth Ward forfeited the game and was dropped from the league in the following week. The rest of its games were considered to be forfeits.

The work was commissioned from Bronzino by Cosimo. It portrays Morgsnte on both sides as a bird-catcher, as he was not permitted to hunt bigger game, this being a pursuit reserved for persons of greater echelon. Morgante is depicted respectively from the front and back at two subequent moments of the action: at the front we see him before the hunt, holding an <a href="owl">owl</a> in a snare to be used as a bait to capture a jay that is flying in the air. A duo of rare <a href="swallowtail%20butterflies">swallowtail butterflies</a> cover his genitals; these were discovered recently, when the painting was last restored. From behind, we see him just about to turn towards the viewer, anxious to visually boast of his take.
At this time Bronzino was involved in the great Florentine debate laid down by <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> called "<a href="Paragone">Paragone</a>", sculpture versus painting. Of course Bronzino came down on the side of painting so he painted this portrait of thebfamed dwarf buffoon court jester favorite Morgante to retort the agruement that a subject could be seen from more angles in sculpture by doing this two sided front and back view canvas of the small person.

In 2010 this work after many years of neglect was restored and placed on permanent display in its own glass case in the <a href="Palazzo%20Pitti">Palazzo Pitti</a>.

Alexander Cunningham of Aiket

Alexander Cunningham of Aiket (died 1592) was a Scottish landowner.

He was a son of John Cunningham and Helen Barclay, daughter of the Laird of Corfin. <a href="Aiket%20Castle">Aiket Castle</a> is in <a href="Dunlop%2C%20East%20Ayrshire">Dunlop</a> parish in <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a>.

<doc id="68478457" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68478457" title="Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc.">
Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc.

Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 135 S.Ct. 1920 (2015), was a 2015 decision by the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> pertaining to the standard for <a href="patent%20infringement%23indirect%20infringement">induced patent infringement</a>. Writing for a 6-2 majority, Justice <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a> held that (1) a claim of induced infringement requires a showing that the defendant knew that it is engaging in infringing conduct and (2) a defendant's belief that a patent is <a href="Patentability">invalid</a> is not a defense to a claim of induced infringement. Justice <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a> dissented from the second point, arguing that, in his view, a good faith belief in a patent's invalidity should constitute a defense to a charge of induced infringement.

Section::::Background.
In 2002, the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> awarded U.S. Patent No. 6,430,395 ("the '395 patent") to Commil. The '395 patent claims as its invention an improved short-range wireless network that allows mobile devices to more quickly and efficiently move between various nodes in a network. 

In 2007, Commil sued <a href="Cisco%20Systems">Cisco Systems</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Texas">United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> alleging infringement of the '395 patent by Cisco's wireless access points and controllers. In 2010, the case was tried to a jury who found that Cisco did not induce others to infringe the '395 patent. The district court overturned this verdict due to certain improper comments made by Cisco's counsel during the trial and ordered a second jury trial. At the second trial, Cisco attempted to argue that it did not induce infringement of the '395 patent because it held a good faith belief that the '395 patent was invalid. However, the district court did not allow Cisco to make this argued and refused to provide Cisco's requested <a href="Jury%20instructions">instruction</a> to the jury. The jury at the second trial subsequently found that Cisco had, in fact, induced infringement of the '395 patent and ordered it to pay $63.8 million in damages.

Cisco appealed this verdict to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>, arguing, among other things, that the district court was incorrect to refuse to instruct the jury on Cisco's good faith belief that the '395 patent was invalid. The Federal Circuit agreed with Cisco and reversed the jury verdict against it. Judge <a href="Pauline%20Newman">Pauline Newman</a> of the Federal Circuit however criticized this ruling and argued that a good faith belief as to the invalidity of a patent was not a defense to induced infringement. Both parties subsequently appealed the Federal Circuit's opinion to the Supreme Court for further review.

Section::::Supreme Court opinion.
The Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 31, 2015 and issued its opinion on May 26, 2015. Justice Kennedy, writing for a 6-2 majority, addressed two issues in the Court's opinion.

First, the Court clarified and reiterated its holding in "<a href="Global-Tech%20v.%20SEB">Global-Tech v. SEB</a>" that, in making a claim for induced infringement, a <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> must show that the <a href="defendant">defendant</a> knew, not only of the patent itself, but also knew that its actions constituted infringement of that patent. Second, the Court considered Cisco's claim that it held a good faith belief that the '395 patent was invalid and found that this assertion, even if true, did not constitute a defense to a claim of induced infringement. The Court's conclusion focused heavily on the distinction between infringement and invalidity, with Justice Kennedy noting that, while invalidity may be a defense to liability in a patent case, it is not separately a defense to a finding of infringement. The Court further considered that, under 35 U.S.C. § 282, a patent is presumed valid such that allowing a good faith belief of invalidity to act as a defense would undermine that presumption. Finally, the Court noted that to rule otherwise would encourage litigants to develop post-hac, litigation-driven invalidity theories solely to escape a finding of induced infringement. Finally, the Court, in a somewhat unusual fashion, devotes a final section of the opinion to a discussion of non-practicing entities, such as <a href="patent%20troll">patent troll</a>s, and notes that precluding this defense does not provide plaintiffs with free license to accuse companies of induced infringement and that defendants have many avenues with which to attack the validity of patents. 

Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a>, dissented from the Court's ruling. While Justice Roberts agreed with the Court's conclusion that inducement requires both knowledge of the patent and of the alleged infringement of that patent, he disagreed with the majority's holding that a good faith belief of invalidity could not act as a defense to a charge of inducement. While Justice Scalia acknowledged that infringement and invalidity are legally distinct concepts, he also noted that, as a practical matter, it was impossible to infringe an invalid patent. 

Section::::Reactions to the Supreme Court's decision.
In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision, legal commentators believed that the decision would have a significant impact on how companies evaluated allegations of patent infringement. <a href="Ronald%20Mann">Ronald Mann</a> of "<a href="SCOTUSblog">SCOTUSblog</a> "expressed surprise at the Court's ruling, noting that Commil had "managed to pull off a hard trick" by "getting a majority of the Justices to ignore the explicit language of an opinion so recent that all of those who signed it are still on the Court." As Mann saw it, the Court's ruling in "<a href="Global-Tech%20v.%20SEB">Global-Tech v. SEB</a>" had implicitly suggested that a good faith belief of invalidity could serve as a defense such that the Court's new decision was a surprising reversal for defendants. <a href="Gene%20Quinn">Gene Quinn</a> of "<a href="IP%20Watchdog">IP Watchdog</a> "remarked that the decision was a "reasonable" one while criticizing several factual errors in the Court's opinion as demonstrating "how little the Supreme Court actually knows about patent law." Other commentators noted that the Court's ruling would likely reduce the number of <a href="patent%20infringement%23Clearance%20searches%20and%20opinions">pre-litigation opinion letters</a> related to invalidity and that companies seeking to minimize infringement claims would be more likely to seek opinions regarding non-infringement. 

Section::::Subsequent proceedings.
Following the Supreme Court's decision, the case was remanded to the Federal Circuit for consideration of how the case should proceed. On remand, the Federal Circuit held that neither Cisco nor its customers infringed the '395 patent and that judgment should be entered in Cisco's favor, thus wiping out the $63.8 million verdict entered by the jury.

According to "Date Seishin Kafu", Morimune gathered the Date clan <a href="Vassal">vassals</a> and led all the officials during the time when the 13th clan head, Morimune's nephew, Date Naomune, was aged from 3 to 15 (1455-1467). However, this is considered impossible because not only the elder brother and 12th clan head, Date Narimune, but also Date Mochimune (died in 1469) were still alive at this time.

In 1591, Date Masamune moved to Iwadeyama due to the Kasai Ōsaki Rebel, when the old territories of Nagai and Date were seized. At this time, Morimune also moved to Esashi-gun. During the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a>, the Koyagawa clan further moved to Notezaki within the same province, and after that, the clan ruled the area until the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>.

Floor areas above the base range from .

275 Madison Avenue was developed by <a href="Houston%20Properties">Houston Properties</a>, a firm headed by Texas entrepreneur <a href="Jesse%20H.%20Jones">Jesse H. Jones</a>, and was originally known as 22 East 40th Street. It opened at the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and Houston Properties sold the skyscraper in 1933 to the <a href="New%20York%20Trust%20Company">New York Trust Company</a>.

In the mid-19th century, the surrounding section of Murray Hill was developed as an upscale residential district, with the estates of many prominent families. Among these estates were three houses at 273, 275, and 277 Madison Avenue, all built in 1862 on lots measuring wide. The three residences served as "the homes of many distinguished citizens of New York". Also on the site were two stables built before 1910 at the addresses 24 and 26 East 40th Street. By 1920, commercial concerns had relocated to the area, which "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called "a great civic centre". The <a href="New%20York%20Trust%20Company">New York Trust Company</a> acquired the old mansion at 277 Madison Avenue in 1922, where it opened a banking branch, and antique bookstore <a href="Rosenbach%20Company">Rosenbach Company</a> occupied number 273 starting in 1920. The Metropolitan Realty Company had planned a 14-story building at 24 and 26 East 40th Street in 1925, but it was not built.

Section::::Design.
275 Madison Avenue was designed by <a href="Kenneth%20Franzheim">Kenneth Franzheim</a> and built by the <a href="Dwight%20P.%20Robinson%20Company">Dwight P. Robinson Company</a> for <a href="Houston%20Properties">Houston Properties</a>. It has also been known as 22 East 40th Street, the Johns-Manville Building, and the American Home Products Building. The building was designed in the <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style with elements of the <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a>. It consists of 43 stories and measures from ground level to the roof. The "New York Herald Tribune" gave a slightly different figure of 42 stories and . 

When completed in 1931, the building was one of the more distinct skyscrapers in the city. "The Wall Street Journal" called it a structure "of novel aspect". The building was also depicted in photographer <a href="Berenice%20Abbott">Berenice Abbott</a>'s "Changing New York" pictorial series. According to architectural critic Carter B. Horsley, 275 Madison Avenue and the nearby 295 Madison Avenue were "two of the city's better Art Deco towers", though Horsley regarded number 295 as the better of the two.

Section::::Form.
275 Madison Avenue is designed with a three-story base of black granite, above which is a 40-story tower clad with white brick and dark terracotta. The building contains <a href="Setback%20%28architecture%29">setbacks</a> on the 4th through 23rd stories to comply with the <a href="1916%20Zoning%20Resolution">1916 Zoning Resolution</a>. The setbacks taper to a rectangular tower on the 24th through 43rd stories. The setbacks were designed with over thirty terraces ranging from . The larger terraces generally face east and west while the smaller terraces generally face north. 

The 40th Street <a href="Elevation%20%28architecture%29">elevation</a> has fourteen vertical <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> at the 4th story, with the center six bays being recessed in a <a href="light%20court">light court</a> between four bays on either side. The center bays form a stepped "peak" with setbacks at the 18th through 21st floors. According to architectural writer <a href="Robert%20A.%20M.%20Stern">Robert A. M. Stern</a>, the pyramidal setbacks resembled those on the nearby <a href="Chanin%20Building">Chanin Building</a>. The four bays to the west and east have setbacks at the 10th and 12th floors. The Madison Avenue elevation has six bays on the 4th through 12th stories, above which is a setback. There are also setbacks at the 14th, 17th, and 20th stories of the northern and western elevations. The eastern elevation rises from the lot line until the 23rd story, where it sets back to the eastern wall of the top twenty stories.

In addition, the top of the tower contains notched corners with small terraces in each corner. The tower's roof was originally flat, but a two-story penthouse was added after the building's completion. The southwestern notch was removed at that time. 

Section::::Facade.
The black granite of the base was quarried in Pennsylvania. The base is designed with black and silver ornamentation, though many of the silver ornament is painted. The base's color scheme was similar to that of the <a href="Fuller%20Building">Fuller Building</a> on Madison Avenue and <a href="57th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">57th Street</a>, as well as the <a href="Bloomingdale%27s">Bloomingdale's</a> building on Lexington Avenue. The tower's <a href="Fenestration%20%28architecture%29">fenestration</a>, or arrangement of window openings, is different than that of the base. Generally, the tower stories contain vertical <a href="Pilaster">pilasters</a> of white brick, which separate the bays of windows. Within each bay, the windows on different floors are separated by <a href="Spandrel">spandrels</a> made of <a href="Architectural%20terracotta">terracotta</a> tiles. The white glazed brick was made in Ohio, while the 1,060 metal window frames were originally made in West Virginia. 

Section::::Base.
The northern elevation on 40th Street contains eight <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a>, with the main entrance being recessed in the fifth bay from the west. The main entrance has revolving and swinging metal doors, above which is a black metal transom bar with the words "275 Madison Avenue". Atop this bar is a transom window split into four rows of five panes. The panes are separated by vertical <a href="Mullion">mullions</a>, which are flared at the bottom and contain seashell-shaped lighting sconces between them. From top to bottom, the rows of openings contain plain windows, <a href="Sash%20window">sash windows</a>, rectangular metal <a href="Spandrel">spandrels</a>, and plain windows. The metal spandrels contain a black representation of a skyscraper with a silver "starburst" motif at the top. On the left wall of the entryway is a metal door. Above the entryway and slightly in front of the building's outer wall, there is a translucent glass panel with the metal characters "275".

West (or right) of the main entrance, in the first through fourth bays from west, are large openings. The openings are each split into three parts: the ground level, ornamented "skyscraper" spandrels, and mezzanine. Each opening has five sets of mezzanine windows above spandrels, which are separated by vertical metal mullions. The ground-level portions of these openings contain a triple-width window flanked by smaller panes. East (left) of the main entrance are three narrower bays. In both the sixth and eighth bays, the ground floor contains large window panes, and there are four sets of spandrel/windows. In the seventh bay, the ground floor has a metal door, topped by a vent and a window pane, as well as signage. The seventh bay has three spandrel/windows, with the center spandrel/window being wider than the outer ones.

The western elevation on Madison Avenue has four bays. The second bay from north has a recessed entrance, which leads to the ground-story banking space inside and was the main entrance prior to 2004. Above the entrance doorway are four windows; the space beneath these window panes is taken up by an octagonal clock and a sign. The first and third bays from north, respectively to the left and right of the Madison Avenue banking entrance, contain a large window pane at ground level and three spandrel/windows above. The fourth bay from north is seven spandrels wide, but there are ventilation grates instead of windows at the mezzanine. This bay has a double door of metal and glass, which leads to a storefront, as well as a shop window.

The third floor has a set of window openings on both 40th Street and Madison Avenue. Along 40th Street, the third-floor window openings are asymmetrically arranged on either side of the main entrance, with twelve to the west (right) of the entrance and six to the east (left). All except one of these openings contain sash windows; the remaining opening has a louver. The openings are separated by silver geometric motifs. Architectural writer <a href="Christopher%20Gray">Christopher Gray</a> wrote the motifs "could be kissing owls, or hooded figures, or the face cards in a deck from another planet". This motif is repeated several times above the main entrance, which is flanked by two flagpoles. On Madison Avenue, there are eight such openings, separated by geometric motifs. Two of these openings have two sash windows each, while the others have one sash window each.

Section::::Tower.
The 4th through 43rd stories have pilasters of continuous white brick, alternating with bays of windows and spandrels. The windows were designed to be flush with the brick. Franzheim avoided decorative elements such as <a href="Cornice">cornices</a>, <a href="Entablature">entablatures</a>, and <a href="Pediment">pediments</a>, as he wanted the building to be "shadow-less". Instead, the tower was to rely exclusively on the contrast between white and black materials for decoration. Terracotta spandrels, between the white pilasters, separate the windows on different stories; they were meant to emphasize the building's height. According to Stern, the spandrels were inspired by those on <a href="Raymond%20Hood">Raymond Hood</a>'s nearby <a href="Daily%20News%20Building">Daily News Building</a>.

The northern and western elevations of the 4th through 23rd stories are designed with white pilasters and dark spandrels, with a few exceptions. At some of the setbacks on the northern and western elevations, the black spandrels are decorated with white-brick geometric shapes. Some of the setbacks also have ornamented white-brick <a href="Lintel">lintels</a> just beneath them. The eastern elevation below the 23rd story has windows within an otherwise flat white-brick wall. The southern elevation below the 23rd story only has windows at the setbacks.

Above the 23rd story, the tower rises as a rectangular shaft, with six bays on the northern elevation and five bays each on the western and eastern elevations. This gives the tower an almost square shape. The two southernmost bays on the western elevation have black panels. The south elevation has eight bays, of which only the three easternmost bays have windows. has black vertical stripes in the first, third, fourth, and fifth bays from west and a pipe in the second bay from the west; only the three easternmost bays have windows. The top of the shaft has a few geometric decorations, similar to those used on the lower section of the tower. The rooftop <a href="parapet">parapet</a> originally had black-and-white <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a>-shaped motifs as well as projecting white brick at the tops of the pilasters. At the roof is a two-story penthouse, which has ribbon windows, steel walls, and <a href="Chamfer">chamfered</a> corners. A metal pipe railing and two tiers of rooftop terraces are at the top of the penthouse.

Section::::Features.
The entrance lobbies had floor surfaces made of Belgian black marble and walls of French black marble. The marble lobby space has nickel trim in the Art Deco style. <a href="Walker%20%26amp%3B%20Gillette">Walker & Gillette</a> designed a bank branch for the New York Trust Company in the first floor, mezzanine, and basement. The branch had bronze tellers' cages, marble-clad main floor, and a Venetian-terrazzo floor in the basement's safe-deposit vaults. The main banking walls were made of English oak and embedded nickel bronze, as well as Byzantine and Belgian black marble. The vault walls were made of an layer of reinforced concrete and a layer of plate steel. , the former banking space was being marketed as a conventional retail space, with in the basement, on the first floor, and on the mezzanine. These stories all had ceiling heights of . 

The elevators were split into two banks: local elevators, which traveled from the ground story to the 22nd floor, and express elevators, which traveled from the 22nd to 42nd floors. The elevators were originally designed to run at a top speed of . According to Franzheim, it would only take a 42nd-story tenant fifty seconds to travel to the ground story "under normal traffic conditions". The building's elevators had exotic woods from numerous countries.

The upper stories had floor areas of between . The building had a total rentable area of either , , or . The <a href="gross%20floor%20area">gross floor area</a> was . The walls of the upper-story corridors were clad with French black marble, while the floors had Belgian black marble interspersed with chips of Italian white marble. Upper-story offices were also wainscoted in French black marble. Walls and partitions were made of tiles and terracotta from across the United States, which were combined with clay from New Jersey. Interior walls were designed so they were, on average, only from the windows. A three-story suite at the top of the building had a private elevator and staircases, as well as executive offices and a greenhouse area.

Section::::History.
275 Madison Avenue was developed by <a href="Jesse%20H.%20Jones">Jesse H. Jones</a>, who had been a major real estate developer in the early 20th century, particularly in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas. Jones expressed interest in developing buildings in New York City and, in 1923, he founded Houston Properties, headed by Alfred B. Jones of New Jersey. Kenneth Franzheim was involved in designing several of Houston Properties' developments; he was part of a relatively small "business family" from which Jesse Jones tended to hire. 

Section::::Development.
In July 1929, the New York Trust Company acquired the property at 275 Madison Avenue, abutting its branch office at number 277. The next month, Philip H. Rosenbach of the Rosenbach Company sold number 273 to the 273 Madison Avenue Corporation. In April 1930, Jesse Jones approached both the New York Trust Company and the owner of 273 Madison Avenue with the intent of acquiring a site large enough for "a tall office building". Frederick Brown had been under contract to purchase number 273, and Jesse Jones intended to lease the site from Brown. Jesse Jones had acquired number 273, as well as two stables on 24 and 26 East 40th Streets, by the following month. He then created the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation. This was part of Jones's frequent practice of creating different companies to operate his building so issues with one property would not affect the others.

In preparation for the skyscraper's construction, New York Trust received authorization in May 1930 to open a temporary branch across the street at 274 Madison Avenue. The bank also leased some space in the proposed skyscraper. Plans for the skyscraper, then called 22 East 40th Street, were filed at the end of June 1930. The structure was slated to cost $1.25 million. The Title Guarantee and Trust Company gave the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation a seven-year, $440,000 mortgage, and the project also received a $3.2 million loan. The old residences were demolished starting on June 21, 1930, and excavations began at the end of the following month, July 31. The steelwork was constructed starting on September 4, followed by the brick four weeks later on October 3. The building had <a href="topped%20out">topped out</a> by December 1930. "The New York Times" published several articles about 22 East 40th Street while it was under construction. Jesse Jones had taken out a <a href="Reconstruction%20Finance%20Corporation">Reconstruction Finance Corporation</a> loan to fund the building's construction.

Section::::1930s and 1940s.
In early 1931, New York Trust temporarily moved out of its existing offices to allow the completion of the skyscraper. The New York Trust bank branch at 22 East 40th Street opened in July 1931. The renting agents, <a href="Cross%20%26amp%3B%20Brown">Cross & Brown</a>, ran advertisements proclaiming that the building was being developed in "Uptown Wall Street" and promising "superior floor arrangements". Among the earliest office tenants were the <a href="Aeronautical%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce</a>, the <a href="American%20Bankers%20Association">American Bankers Association</a>, the <a href="American%20Safety%20Razor%20Company">American Safety Razor Company</a>, the <a href="Radio%20Manufacturers%20Association">Radio Manufacturers Association</a>, accounting firm <a href="Haskins%20%26amp%3B%20Sells">Haskins & Sells</a>, paper distributor <a href="Gottesman%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Gottesman & Co.</a>, and Swedish royal family relative <a href="Folke%20Bernadotte">Folke Bernadotte</a>. Franzheim's office and engineering companies Fish & Loenenger and Krey & Hunt took the top three floors. The early tenants also included law firms, a publicist, a real estate broker, and publishers, as well as attorneys and a firm of sales management engineers.

Houston Properties ran into financial difficulties soon after it completed the building. This came with a general downturn in real estate development in the area caused by the Depression. In July 1932, the 275 Madison Avenue Corporation filed a lawsuit against the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation to foreclose on a $5.5 million <a href="second%20mortgage">second mortgage</a> on 22 East 40th Street. The 275 Madison Avenue Corporation was operated by New York Trust, which took over operation in 1933. After the <a href="Johns%20Manville">Johns Manville</a> Corporation leased six floors at 22 East 40th Street for its general headquarters in January 1933, the building also became known for the company. Some <a href="Receivership">receivers</a> were named for the building, but their appointments were vacated that December in the <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court">New York Supreme Court</a>. The ruling was made on the basis that the plaintiff who had no more than a 2-percent stake in the building. 

The building continued to face financial difficulties. When the <a href="Marine%20Midland%20Bank">Marine Midland Bank</a> extended a $3.2 million mortgage on the building in 1934, the tax, water, and <a href="Amortization%20%28business%29">amortization</a> fees were in <a href="arrears">arrears</a> due to missed payments. By the late 1930s, the building was increasingly being referred to as 275 Madison Avenue, though some news media still referred to the building by its 40th Street address. 275 Madison Avenue was sold in March 1943 to a group of businessmen, and Brown Wheelock Harris Stevens Inc. took over the leasing. <a href="American%20Home%20Products">American Home Products</a> simultaneously leased most of the building's top 23 stories as headquarters offices for the main company and nine subsidiaries. The building's valuation was assessed as $3.05 million at the time. American Home Products had reportedly only been interested in buying 275 Madison Avenue if it were able to occupy 13 floors by May 1, 1943.

Section::::1950s to 1970s.
American Home Products sold the building in November 1951 to <a href="Tishman%20Realty%20%26amp%3B%20Construction">Tishman Realty & Construction</a>, which leased back to American Home Products. The deal reportedly involved more than $5 million, all in cash. At the time, American Home Products occupied 17 full stories and portions of seven others, and New York Trust, Johns-Mansville, <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>, <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a>, and <a href="Provident%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Company">Provident Mutual Insurance Company</a> also occupied the building. The sale was finalized in January 1952, and Tishman secured a first mortgage of $3.2 million from the <a href="Metropolitan%20Life%20Insurance%20Company">Metropolitan Life Insurance Company</a>. Tishman sold the building in 1953 to the <a href="MassMutual">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company</a>, though Tishman took back a long-term lease. Johns-Manville occupied on 12 stories, and American Home Products occupied on 24 stories. The next year, Tishman installed an air-conditioning system in Johns-Manville's offices while 800 employees continued to work in the space. <a href="Lawrence%20Wien">Lawrence Wien</a> and <a href="Harry%20Helmsley">Harry Helmsley</a> took a long-term lease on the building in 1955.

The Equity Corporation began operating 275 Madison Avenue in 1959, the same year that American Home Products leased space for a new headquarters at 685 Third Avenue. American Home Products moved out of the building in 1961, leaving available for lease, about 45 percent of the entire building. The stories being vacated were relatively small, ranging from , so the space was marketed to smaller tenants as cheap offices near Grand Central. Within two years, American Home Products' space was taken by companies in numerous industries. The new lessees included an import/export company, a realty company. an accounting firm, and the <a href="Equity%20Funding">Equity Funding</a> Corporation. In 1962, Madison Park Associates acquired the leasehold from the 22 East 40th Street Equity Corporation; both companies were headed by Stanley and Max Stahl. At the time, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company owned the structure. Also in the 1960s, Goldman-DiLorenzo bought the land.

Johns-Manville, the building's major tenant, announced in 1971 that it would move its corporate headquarters to a suburb of <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado. Goldman-DiLorenzo acquired the lease on the building itself in 1973. Goldman-DiLorenzo acquired a $2.8 million mortgage on the property's leasehold, increasing its <a href="Leverage%20%28finance%29">leverage</a>. This led to large losses when office spaces in comparable buildings began to rise, and the first mortgage holder, <a href="CNA%20Financial">CNA Financial</a>, had begun foreclosure proceedings by 1976. The second mortgage was paid down to $1.8 million, and the second-mortgage holder <a href="Gibraltar%20Financial%20Corporation">Gibraltar Financial</a> absorbed much of the losses. The Williams Real Estate Company took over management, at which point the building was 15 percent vacant.

Section::::1980s to present.
Coronet Properties sold the building for $22 million to New Madison-275 Associates, headed by <a href="Alain%20DeBerc">Alain DeBerc</a>, in 1980. The buyer was acting on behalf of foreign <a href="Syndicated%20loan">syndication</a> firm Gestam Inc., which leased space to ten tenants within months of the purchase. The owner planned to renovate 275 Madison Avenue. At the time, the building's only entrance was on 40th Street, a situation that had existed since the building was constructed. The owners decided to create an expanded lobby and a new entrance within part of the Madison Avenue storefront after the expiration of a lease there. <a href="Oppenheimer%20Brady%20and%20Vogelstein">Oppenheimer Brady and Vogelstein</a> designed a $2 million renovation that also included mechanical upgrades and restoration of design features. The new lobby had mirrored wall panels accented with stainless steel, as well as Art Deco chandeliers. Rose marble was imported from the same quarry in France that had provided marble for the original lobby.

The former banking space on Madison Avenue was renovated in 1995, and decorative elements on the facade were also restored. By then, the building's tenants included firms in law, accounting, publishing, cosmetics, public relations, and computer publishing. In 1996, the owners of 275 Madison Avenue and the nearby <a href="370%20Lexington%20Avenue">370 Lexington Avenue</a> received a combined $27.5 million in loans from the <a href="Mutual%20Life%20Insurance%20Company%20of%20New%20York">Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York</a>. Two years later, in 1998, <a href="Aby%20Rosen">Aby Rosen</a> and Michael Fuchs of <a href="RFR%20Realty">RFR Realty</a> bought the lease on 275 Madison Avenue for $42 million. The company had an option to buy the underlying land for $19 million but did not execute the option at that time. The base of the building was modified in 2004, when the main entrance was relocated from Madison Avenue to 40th Street. The <a href="New%20York%20City%20Landmarks%20Preservation%20Commission">New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> designated the building as a city landmark on January 13, 2009.

RFR Realty placed the building for sale in April 2016. The RPW Group, headed by Robert Weisz, offered over $270 million for the building less than two months after the sale was announced. That August, <a href="the%20Blackstone%20Group">the Blackstone Group</a> and <a href="SL%20Green%20Realty">SL Green Realty</a> gave RPW a $240 million loan to finance the purchase. Two years later, RPW refinanced the building with a $210 million loan from <a href="Ullico">Ullico</a>. <a href="Saadia%20Group">Saadia Group</a>, parent company of <a href="Lord%20%26amp%3B%20Taylor">Lord & Taylor</a>, leased some space in early 2021.

<doc id="68478572" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68478572" title="Doelistenmovement">
Doelistenmovement

The Doelisten were an orangist civic movement in Amsterdam, named after its primary meeting location the <a href="Kloveniersdoelen%2C%20Amsterdam">Kloveniersdoelen</a> (or 'de Doelen' in short), which opposed the power of the Amsterdam mayors in the summer of <a href="1748">1748</a>.

Section::::The emergence of the movement.
The cause which led to the formation of the civil movement was an eleven articles long petition which circulated among the civil militia just after the <a href="Pachtersoproer">Pachtersoproer</a>. This petition, which historian <a href="Pieter%20Geyl">Pieter Geyl</a> called a 'decisive democratic program', advocated radical reforms to the functioning of the city's governing bodies such as the election of the <a href="vroedschap">vroedschap</a> and directors of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">East</a> and <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">West India Company</a> by the citizenry.

Through the correspondence between agent of the English King Richard Wolters and the Rotterdam cake baker <a href="Laurens%20van%20der%20Meer">Laurens van der Meer</a>, <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Stadholder Willem IV</a> learned of the activities of the Amsterdam 'democrats'. He then sent Van der Meer to Amsterdam to get a better idea what was going on within the reformist movement. In Amsterdam, Van der Meer was introduced to the leaders of the radical movement, including <a href="Jean%20Rousset%20de%20Missy">Jean Rousset de Missy</a>, <a href="Hendrik%20van%20Gimnig">Hendrik van Gimnig</a> and <a href="Andries%20Boekelman">Andries Boekelman</a>, through an office clerk <a href="Jacob%20de%20Huyser">Jacob de Huyser</a>. They indicated to Van der Meer that they intended to turn the city government upside down, without needing the stadtholder to do so.

At a later time, contact was re-established between Van der Meer and De Huyser. De Huyser invited Van der Meer to come back to Amsterdam, where they started working on an alternative petition comprising three articles. This petition contained much more moderate proposals: they demanded the transfer of the revenues of the postal administration to the region, an end to nepotism in the allocation of city posts, the restoration of the rights and privileges of the guilds and the election of the senior officers of the <a href="Civil%20militia">Civil Militia</a>.

Section::::The gatherings at the Kloveniersdoelen.
On August 9, the first public meeting took place at the <a href="Kloveniersdoelen%2C%20Amsterdam">Kloveniersdoelen</a>. Both the radical eleven-article petition and the moderate three-article petition were to be presented this afternoon. Initially, the Doelisten occupied the Rondeel hall, but due to the great interest the radical Doelists had to move to the Grote Burgerzaal, where the literary society the Ridders van het Heelal was meeting at that time. Van Gimnig opened the meeting in the Grote Burgerzaal with a fiery speech full of references to a glorious past, the present of the decline of the Republic, the occupation by the French and the return of the stadtholder. This speech was intended to convince the public to support his eleven articles. Afterwards, he offered the petition for signature, which it is said that hundreds of people responded to. In the meantime, a smaller number of Doelisten of moderate origin had stayed behind in the Rondeel, where they discussed the three articles drafted by de Huyser and Van der Meer. When De Huyser decided to take their petition to the Grote Burgerzaal, he and his moderates reportedly did not stand out from the crowd.

It is only after Van der Meer managed to recruit the porcelain seller <a href="Daniel%20Raap">Daniël Raap</a> for the moderate faction that they gained significant support. The charismatic Raap had already made important contributions to reformists in Amsterdam in November by, for example, devoting himself to making stadholdership hereditary and advocating to end the abuses regarding the distribution of government jobs. At the meeting at the Kloveniersdoelen of 10 August, he managed to convince a large part of the public with his speech of his criticism of the eleven-point petition and to convince them of the importance of the more moderate petition. In the days that followed Raap traveled up and down to <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> for an interview with the stadtholder and his wife <a href="Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Princess%20of%20Orange">Princess Anna</a>. He managed to get the support of the stadtholder and then 52 of the militia districts behind him for the three-article petition. On August 17, Raap, De Huyser and Ellie Chatin were summoned to the town hall where the mayors received the three articles of petition. The mayors asked the moderate leaders in exchange for considering the three-article petition to stop the meetings at the Kloveniersdoelen. Raap and his followers promised to do their utmost for this. However, Raap and his friends noted that they could not afford to suppress the radicals too hard at the risk of turning the mob against them.

On 21 August, the audience at the Kloveniersdoelen heard of the mayors' response to the three-article petition. The mayors had not, to their disappointment, made any commitment to implement any of the articles in the petition. This caused much anger at the meeting. More and more calls were made for violent protests and the overthrow of the city government. Raap and his followers had the greatest difficulty in subduing the crowd. Under pressure from the radicalizing voices at the Kloveniersdoelen, the mayors agreed to the three articles of appeal on 27 August. The next day, the vroedschap also agreed.

Meanwhile, the moderates managed to get a promise from the stadholder on 26 August to go to Amsterdam to restore order to the city. The radicals saw this as an excuse to choose representatives from the "<a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>" who were to represent the interests of the burghers to the stadtholder. Although many moderates enthusiastically participated in the election, Raap and his moderate allies were vehemently against electing commissioners. Despite Raap's opposition, commissioners were elected in most of the 60 Amsterdam militia districts. These representatives regularly met at de Graaf van Holland inn.

On 29 August <a href="Willem%20Bentinck%20van%20Rhoon">Willem Bentinck van Rhoon</a> came to Amsterdam to prepare the stadholder's visit. He managed to get the concessions from Raap, Van Gimnig and the city government that the stadtholder could act as a mediator and that the decisions the stadtholder would take in this regard would be accepted by all parties. In addition, the Doelisten promised to keep the peace in Amsterdam during the stadholder's visit. In the days that followed, Van Gimnig and his commissioners, as well as Raap and his allies, both drafted a petition to present to the stadtholder.

On August 31, in response to an anti-goalist petition, a large solidarity demonstration was held in Amsterdam. At the request of the committee meeting, the 'Bijltjes' - the nickname for the shipwrights of Amsterdam - were mobilized to enter the city unarmed, together with civilians dressed as axes, to thwart the signing of the anti-Doelist pamphlet.

Section::::The arrival of the Stadtholder.
On September 2, <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Stadtholder William IV</a> arrived in Amsterdam, staying at the Oudezijds Heerenlogement. In the days after his arrival, the stadtholder received deputations from the parties involved. Six people from the Doelisten were allowed to join from the committee meeting led by Van Gimnig and six people led by Raap. They uniformly pressured the stadtholder to dismiss and replace the mayors and the city council and to institute independent leadership to the civil militia, meaning a leadership without any members associated to ruling "<a href="regenten">regenten</a>" class. Despite the fact that these were painful decisions, the Stadtholder relented. On September 5, the stadtholder informed the four mayors of Amsterdam Willem Sautijn, Jan Six, Gerrit Corver and H.H. van de Poll that they would be fired from their position. They were succeeded by Cornelis Trip, Ferdinand van Collen, Gerard Aarnout Hasselaar and Willem Gideon Deutz. On the advice of <a href="Mattheus%20Lestevenon">Mattheus Lestevenon</a>, seventeen council members were replaced, nineteen were able to keep their seats. It became a provisional government until February 1. Among the newcomers were twelve merchants who were appointed to promote trade.

The matter with the civil militia was at this point still not settled. It was rumored that the prince wanted two colonels appointed by the government and three by the citizenry. The Doelisten were dissatisfied and wanted to <a href="defenestrate">defenestrate</a> the negotiators. At night an incensed crowd stood in front of the Oudezijds Heerenlogement and demanded to speak to the Stadtholder. Eight were admitted. On September 10, the stadtholder promised that an independent civil militia leadership would be established. In the militia districts, fierce elections were held to appoint the new officers. However, there was a lot of unrest in the neighborhoods about the choice of captains. For example, it was often unclear how the captains should be elected and some captains had ties to the new government or lived outside the district. Despite the chaotic elections, the city government confirmed all newly elected officers of the Civil Militia on September 13.

On Sunday 15 September, the prince left - after the church service - for The Hague. Shortly after his departure, a proclamation from the prince announced that the newly established independent court-martial would be overturned and that the old leadership of the Civil Militia would be restored.

Section::::The aftermath.
Because the Stadtholder did not honor or even walked back on certain demands, there was a lot of dissatisfaction. The initial admiration for the stadtholder slowly turned into contempt. In the election for mayor in 1752, the <a href="Orangism%20%28Dutch%20Republic%29">Orangist</a> candidates were defeated. At the same time, the old and new elite united in an anti-Orangist bloc. The mayors informed the princes Anne, who then became the regent for the Stadtholder, that they would no longer send her a nomination for the appointment of two mayors and aldermen. On March 6, 1752, a large number of Amsterdam regents signed the so-called Correspondence of "Pointen van Ordre". In this new system, abuse of power on the part of mayors or the stadtholder was countered by seniority: of the members of the Correspondence, the elders would first be discussed.

Nesta Roberts

Nesta Roberts (10 January 1913 – 16 January 2009) was a Welsh journalist and author, the first woman to be in charge of the news desk on a British national newspaper. She served as Paris correspondent of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" from 1965 to 1972.

Section::::Early life.
The daughter of a merchant seaman, Roberts grew up in North Wales, speaking both English and Welsh, and was educated at <a href="St%20Winifred%27s%20School">St Winifred's School</a>, <a href="Llanfairfechan">Llanfairfechan</a>.

Section::::Career.
Roberts began work as a journalist on a weekly newspaper in South Wales and pursued her career in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. At the age of nineteen, she made her first contributions to what was then "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", writing articles called "backpagers" at three <a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29">guineas</a> each.

In 1937, Roberts’s first book appeared, a history of the first fifty years of her old school, St Winifred's.

An article called "Single to Manchester" led to Roberts joining the staff of "The Manchester Guardian" in May 1947. She later joined the news room staff in Manchester, remaining there for eleven years and becoming deputy news editor. When the newspaper began to be printed in London in 1961, Roberts was appointed as its first news editor there, becoming the first woman to hold such a position on a British national newspaper. However, as she had no experience of organizing specialist reporters, she saw herself as an odd choice by the editor, <a href="Alastair%20Hetherington">Alastair Hetherington</a> who was to go on working in Manchester. After two years, she was succeeded as news editor by <a href="John%20Cole%20%28journalist%29">John Cole</a> and went back to writing articles on health and welfare. She also wrote books on healthcare.

In 1965, Roberts was sent to Paris to cover for the sickness of the Paris correspondent <a href="Darsie%20Gillie">Darsie Gillie</a>. She soon became the permanent post-holder and held the job for seven years, which proved to be her last with "The Guardian".

In April 1968, Roberts raised concerns about a marked fall in the birth-rate in France, proposing that higher family allowances would encourage larger families. During the <a href="May%2068">May 68</a> upheavals, her radical political instincts led her to support the students.

After retiring from working for "The Guardian" full-time, Roberts stayed in France, contributing an occasional column called "Letters from Paris". She called the French "the least boring people in Europe", and was the author of "The Face of France" (1976) and "Companion Guide to Normandy" (1980).

Section::::Retirement.
On her return from France, Roberts retired to live in <a href="Louth%2C%20Lincolnshire">Louth</a>, in Lincolnshire, attracted by the <a href="High%20Anglicanism">High Anglicanism</a> of its <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a>.

Rockabilly Fever

Rockabilly Fever is a <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American recording artist <a href="Wanda%20Jackson">Wanda Jackson</a>. It was released in 1984 via Tab Records for the Scandinavian market in Europe. It was then re-released to other markets, including Jackson's home country in 1986 and was re-titled "Rock and Roll Away Your Blues". 

The album was Jackson's thirtieth in her career and her first to contain <a href="Rockabilly">Rockabilly</a> recordings in several decades. One single was released from the record in 1985 and the album received positive reviews from critics. 

Section::::Background.
Early in her career, Wanda Jackson became one of the first women to record Rockabilly (later known as <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>) and <a href="Country%20music">country</a> music. She achieved commercial success in both fields with singles like "<a href="Fujiyama%20Mama">Fujiyama Mama</a>", "<a href="Let%27s%20Have%20a%20Party">Let's Have a Party</a>", "<a href="Right%20or%20Wrong%20%28Wanda%20Jackson%20song%29">Right or Wrong</a>" and "<a href="The%20Box%20It%20Came%20In">The Box It Came In</a>". She left her long-time record label in the 1970s to pursue <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a> and only occasionally performed secular concerts. In the 1980s, Rockabilly revived in Europe and Jackson's music from that era gained renewed interest from fans. In her autobiography, Jackson recalled receiving a phone call from Swedish businessman Harry Holmes in summer 1984. Holmes had started a record label and invited Jackson to record a rock album for him. With careful consideration Jackson and her husband agreed.

Section::::Recording and songs.
In September 1984, Jackson traveled to <a href="Kumla">Kumla, Sweden</a> to record what would become "Rockabilly Fever". The project was produced by Swedish record producer Kenth Larsson at the Music Mill Recording Studio in Kumla alongside entirely Swedish session musicians. She described the session musicians in her 2017 book as "Swedish rockabilly fanatics". She also recalled a pleasant surprise to record not only Rockabilly music, but also gospel music. 

A total of 12 tracks comprised the original album, most of which were Rockabilly numbers. Jackson recorded mostly covers of previously successful Rockabilly songs by other performers. Included was her version of <a href="Connie%20Francis">Connie Francis</a>' "<a href="Stupid%20Cupid">Stupid Cupid</a>", <a href="Brenda%20Lee">Brenda Lee</a>'s "<a href="Sweet%20Nothin%27s">Sweet Nothin's</a>", <a href="The%20Crickets">The Crickets</a>'s "<a href="Oh%2C%20Boy%21%20%28The%20Crickets%20song%29">Oh, Boy!</a>" and "<a href="Rave%20On">Rave On</a>", <a href="Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>' "<a href="Breathless%20%28Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%20song%29">Breathless</a>" and <a href="Conway%20Twitty">Conway Twitty</a>'s "<a href="It%27s%20Only%20Make%20Believe">It's Only Make Believe</a>".

Also included were several new cuts, including "Rock and Roll Away Your Blues", "Meet Me in Stockholm", "Sad Love Songs" and the gospel track "Ain't It the Gospel".

Having gone through it, and him really believing it was his masterpiece, and having it be doomed, was devastating."

After Lonergan hired Rosengart as his legal counsel, Gilbert filed for dismissal of the lawsuit after it was clear that Damon, Ruffalo, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, and other Hollywood notables were prepared to testify on behalf of Lonergan. Lonergan attributed the outcome of the case to Rosengart, saying in an interview, "After five years of expensive and highly contentious litigation, the plaintiff suddenly dropped all of his claims in the middle of the trial, without any guarantee of ever receiving a dime."

Section::::"Sandton Capital v. Gold Circle Films".
Sandton Capital Partners, a hedge fund, hired Mathew Rosengart to defend a lawsuit against <a href="Gold%20Circle%20Films">Gold Circle Films</a>. The film production company had taken out roughly $76 million in loans from <a href="CIT%20Group">CIT Bank</a>. CIT Bank then sold the loans to Sandton. Rosengart represented Sandton and asserted counterclaims after Gold Circle sued Sandton. The lawsuit was resolved in 2019 after a trial when <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court">New York Supreme Court</a> Judge Barry Ostrager ordered Gold Circle Films to repay the balance of the loans, which equaled $14 million.

Section::::"ISE v. Jimmy Butler".
<a href="Jimmy%20Butler">Jimmy Butler</a>, the <a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> All-Star guard, hired Mathew Rosengart as his legal counsel after his former sports management group, Independent Sports & Entertainment LLC (ISE), sued Butler for breach of contract in 2020. The lawsuit requested roughly $1 million of Butler's earnings from his <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> endorsement contract, worth $5 million. Rosengart developed a new legal strategy involving counterclaims that Butler was an “artist” under <a href="California">California</a> law, which would have required ISE to have a special license issued by the California Labor Commissioner. ISE lacked the necessary license and opted to drop the litigation.

Section::::"State of California et al. v. Cellco Partnership DBA Verizon Wireless et al.".
Between 2014 and 2021, Rosengart served as lead counsel for Verizon in a False Claims Act lawsuit involving claims that Verizon, <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a>, <a href="Sprint%20Corporation">Sprint</a>, and <a href="T-Mobile">T-Mobile</a> overcharged government customers. California government entities alleged that the telecommunications carriers failed to meet contractual obligations concerning affordable cellphone plans. The plaintiffs demanded more than $1.5 billion from the defendants. The parties negotiated a settlement that allowed Verizon to pay $68 million instead. Combined, the telecommunications companies settled for a total of $116 million.

Section::::Britney Spears.
On July 14, 2021, singer <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> hired Rosengart to represent her interests in her conservatorship dispute. Rosengart was hired after Judge <a href="Brenda%20J.%20Penny">Brenda J. Penny</a> ruled that Spears could hire her own legal counsel to replace the court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, who resigned after Spears announced her decision to retire from her music career. It was noted that the hiring of Rosengart signaled a more "aggressive" approach to the case.

On July 26, 2021, Rosengart filed a petition with the Los Angeles Superior Court requesting that Spears's father, <a href="James%20Parnell%20Spears">Jamie Spears</a>, be suspended or removed from his position as conservator of her estate. Rosengart's petition alleged Jamie had committed multiple acts of mismanagement and that his suspension or removal was in the best interests of Spears.

The petition came on the heels of Spears's accusations against her father on June 23, 2021, alleging that Jamie has been abusing his authority and taking financial advantage of her. On February 1, 2008, Spears was involuntarily admitted for mental health treatment by her then-estranged father. Jamie was named her co-conservator the same day. The conservatorship grants Jamie control over his daughter's fortune of nearly $60 million.

On August 5, 2021, Rosengart filed a petition requesting the court to reschedule the next hearing from September 29 to August 23 or immediately suspend the Jamie's position as co-conservator. The request was denied without prejudice by Judge <a href="Brenda%20J.%20Penny">Brenda J. Penny</a>.

On August 12, 2021, in response to Rosengart's petition, Jamie filed paperwork with the Los Angeles Superior Court to remove himself as conservator. Spears conservatorship will temporarily remain with her father until the transition to a new financial conservator is completed.

Rosengart expressed his approval for Jamie's decision to step down but indicated that he may still face legal repercussions for profiting from Spears's estate. Rosengart stated, "We are pleased that Mr. Spears and his lawyer have today conceded in a filing that he must be removed. It is vindication for Britney. We are disappointed, however, by their ongoing shameful and reprehensible attacks on Ms. Spears and others." Rosengart went on to note that the investigation into allegations of Jamie's financial mismanagement would continue and that he would likely be deposed by Rosengart. Rosengart asserted that Jamie had "profited handsomely" from his daughter's estate, paying himself a percentage of her earnings.

On September 22, 2021, Rosengart filed a supplemental petition calling for the immediate resignation of Mr. Spears as the conservator of the estate, stating "While the entire conservatorship is promptly wound down and formally terminated, it is clear that Mr. Spears cannot be permitted to hold a position of control over his daughter for another day.” Rosengart also requested a hearing on the continued mismanagement of Spears's estate by her father and the outstanding accounting and financial issues surrounding the conservatorship, citing “unwarranted commissions from his daughter’s work, totaling millions of dollars.” 

On September 29, 2021, Judge Brenda Penny granted Rosengart's petition to suspend Jamie Spears immediately from his position as his daughter’s conservator. Rosengart called the ruling, "a substantial step towards her freedom" and stated, "We achieved exactly what we sought out to achieve and that's justice." Rosengart asked the judge for an orderly transition and ultimately a termination of the conservatorship entirely. In a press conference following the decision Rosengart said, "Britney Spears has been faced with a decade long nightmare, a Kafkaesque nightmare, orchestrated by her father and others and she's so thankful to all of you."

Section::::Professional and community involvement.
Rosengart served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at <a href="Fordham%20University%20School%20of%20Law">Fordham Law School</a> teaching Criminal Procedure and presently serves on the Board of Governors of the Beverly Hills Bar Association and on the Dean's Advisory Council of Tulane University.

Erich Schmiedicke

Erich Schmiedicke (13 May 1887 – date of death unknown) was a German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> official and politician.

Section::::Early life.
Schmiedicke was born the son of a fire chief in Neustettin (today, <a href="Szczecinek">Szczecinek</a>). After attending "<a href="volksschule">volksschule</a>" and "<a href="Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29">gymnasium</a>", Schmiedicke trained on German and English sailing ships for a career as a ship’s officer in the <a href="merchant%20marine">merchant marine</a>. From 1910 to 1912 he served as an officer in the Australian merchant navy and also attended the Nautical Academy in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. After his return to Germany, Schmiedicke joined the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> as a one-year volunteer from 1912 to 1913. He attended <a href="helmsman">helmsman</a>’s school in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, passed the German helmsman's examination in March 1914 and joined the German merchant navy until the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

From August 2, 1914 until the end of the war in 1918, Schmiedicke again served in the Imperial Navy as a "<a href="Leutnant%20zur%20See">Leutnant zur See</a>" and "<a href="Oberleutnant%20zur%20See">Oberleutnant zur See</a>". From 1914 to March 1917 he was posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Division">Mediterranean Division</a> aboard the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> <a href="SMS%20Goeben">SMS Goeben</a> and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> <a href="SMS%20Breslau">SMS Breslau</a>. From April 1917 to August 1918 he served in a staff position in the high command of the German naval forces in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. In the last months of the war, he was the Naval <a href="Liaison%20Officer">Liaison Officer</a> to the <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n fleet in <a href="Varna%2C%20Bulgaria">Varna</a>. In 1919 and 1920, Schmiedicke was a member of the "<a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>". Returning to civilian life, he was employed as a freelance salesman in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> from 1919 to 1930.

Section::::Nazi career.
In August 1922, Schmiedicke joined the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> (NSDAP) and its paramilitary branch, the "<a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>" (SA). He was a co-founder of the first "Ortsgruppe" (Local Group) in Berlin and organized the first SA branch in the capital as well. He headed the SA Berlin branch until the ban on the Party and the SA in the wake of the failed <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a> in November 1923. When the ban was lifted, Schmiedicke reenrolled on 11 May 1925 (membership number 4,366) and was named Deputy "<a href="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a>" for Gau Gross-Berlin under "Gauleiter" <a href="Ernst%20Schlange">Ernst Schlange</a>.

The Gau organization in Berlin in early 1926 has been described as being “in a state of disarray bordering on chaos,” with the "Gauleiter" completely unable to quell the internal feuds that were plaguing the organization. Consequently, on 28 February 1926, Schlange was placed on leave due to his inability to heal the divisions within the local Party and Schmiedicke was left in charge as Acting "Gauleiter".
Schlange officially resigned on 20 June 1926 and Schmiedicke continued to lead the Gau; however, he was also unable to bring unity to the squabbling factions. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> determined that an outside leader was needed to restore order and offered the position to <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>. Schmiedicke himself wrote to Goebbels on 16 October urging him to take the post. Gau Gross-Berlin was merged with Gau Potsdam to form the expanded new <a href="Gau%20Berlin">Gau Berlin-Brandenburg</a> on 28 October and Goebbels became "Gauleiter". Goebbels gave the post of Deputy "Gauleiter" to <a href="Kurt%20Daluege">Kurt Daluege</a>, and Schmiedicke was temporarily out of a job.

In 1931 Schmiedicke was appointed as Business Manager for Gau Brandenburg (which again had been separated from Gau Berlin in 1928) and the next year he also became its Deputy "Gauleiter", again under Ernst Schlange. At the 5 March 1933 "<a href="Reichstag%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29">Reichstag</a>" election, Schmiedicke was elected as a deputy for electoral constituency 4 (Potsdam I). When "Gauleiter" Schlange resigned on 16 March 1933, Schmiedicke again was elevated to Acting "Gauleiter". His time in charge was even shorter than in Berlin, however, because Gau Brandenburg was merged with the neighboring Gau Ostmark to form <a href="Gau%20Mark%20Brandenburg">Gau Kurmark</a> and on 1 June was placed under the leadership of <a href="Wilhelm%20Kube">Wilhelm Kube</a>, the incumbent Ostmark "Gauleiter".

In July 1933, Schmiedicke was named Acting "<a href="Burgomaster">Oberburgermeister</a>" (Mayor) of the city of <a href="Guben">Guben</a> in eastern Brandenburg, as well as police administrator for the city. Additionally, on 15 August 1933, he was made Nazi Party "<a href="Kreisleiter">Kreisleiter</a>" (County Leader) for the Guben region. On 19 October he was elected for a twelve year term as the Guben "Oberburgermeister". On 29 July 1934, "Gauleiter" Kube bestowed upon Schmiedicke the title of Honorary Deputy "Gauleiter". In July 1935, he was named <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n Provincial Councilor ("Provinzialrat") for the Provinces of <a href="Province%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> and <a href="Posen-West%20Prussia">Posen-West Prussia</a>. In March of 1937, he was specifically authorized by Hitler to wear the uniform and insignia of a former Deputy "Gauleiter".

Schmiedicke rejoined the SA on 9 November 1938 with the rank of SA-"<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>", and was placed in charge of "Standarte" 451 (Guben). In the autumn of 1944, he led a "<a href="Volkssturm">Volkssturm</a>" battalion in Guben. He most likely fled from the city when it was evacuated in February 1945 ahead of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> advance. The details of his death are not known.

Ubaldo degli Uberti

Ubaldo degli Uberti (<a href="Naples">Naples</a>, 10 March 1881 – <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, 27 April 1945) was an <a href="Italy">Italian</a> admiral during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. 

Section::::Biography.
A descendant of Florentine nobleman and <a href="Ghibelline">Ghibelline</a> leader <a href="Farinata%20degli%20Uberti">Farinata degli Uberti</a>, he was born in Naples in 1881. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, in 1916, Degli Uberti, who held at the time the rank of <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a>, was given command of the <a href="submarine">submarine</a> "Giacinto Pullino", based in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, carrying out a number of patrols in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. Between 3 and 6 July 1916 Pullino torpedoed and damaged Austro-Hungarian steamer "San Mauro" just outside of the harbour of <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a>, permanently disabling it, and then evaded hunt by six Austro-Hungarian <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s and three <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s. For this action he was awarded a <a href="War%20Cross%20for%20Military%20Valor">War Cross for Military Valor</a>.

On the night of 29 July 1916, during another patrol, "Pullino" ran aground in heavy fog in the Gulf of <a href="Kvarner">Kvarner</a>. After unsuccessfully trying to free the submarine for several hours, at dawn Degli Uberti concluded that it would have to be abandoned; after destroying all secret documents and sabotaging the submarine in order to prevent its capture, the crew tried to escape towards Italy in a <a href="sailboat">sailboat</a> that a party led by the executive officer had found on the nearby coast, but they were intercepted and taken prisoner by an Austro-Hungarian warship. The incident was most notable because <a href="Istria">Istria</a>n <a href="Italian%20irredentism">irredentist</a> <a href="Nazario%20Sauro">Nazario Sauro</a> was part of "Pullino"'s crew, serving as pilot; being an Austro-Hungarian citizen, after his capture he was tried for <a href="treason">treason</a>, sentenced to death, and executed by the Austro-Hungarians. Degli Uberti and his men spent the rest of the war in a <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>.

Having resumed service in 1918, Degli Uberti left the Navy in the late 1920s, owing to disagreements with his superiors, in order to pursue a writing career. In 1934 he met American poet <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, then living in <a href="Rapallo">Rapallo</a>, becoming his translator into <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>. Sharing the same <a href="Fascism">political positions</a> and economic theories, Degli Uberti and Pound formed a deep friendship. Moreover, Pound, interested in <a href="Middle%20Age">medieval</a> Italian symbolism, was fascinated by Degli Uberti and his lineage, affectionately nicknaming him "UB2". The friendship between Degli Uberti and Pound would continue even during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and they continued to maintain a close exchange of letters, both siding with the <a href="Italian%20Social%20Republic">Italian Social Republic</a>; Pound would later mention him in his <a href="The%20Cantos">"Cantos"</a>.

Degli Uberti returned to active service in the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Navy">Royal Italian Navy</a> after Italy's entrance into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; in 1941 he was promoted to <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> and entrusted with the <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="press%20office">press office</a> of the Regia Marina. He was director of the weekly Navy <a href="magazine">magazine</a> "Prore armate" and promoted films such as <a href="Roberto%20Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>'s "<a href="La%20nave%20bianca">La nave bianca</a>".

After the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Armistice of Cassibile</a>, Degli Uberti was one of the few Italian admirals who joined the Italian Social Republic; in the autumn of 1943 he became head of the presss and propaganda office of the <a href="Marina%20Nazionale%20Repubblicana">Marina Nazionale Repubblicana</a> (with headquarters in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, later moved to <a href="Montecchio%20Maggiore">Montecchio Maggiore</a>) and director of its magazine "Marina Repubblicana". The magazine hosted an <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> by Ezra Pound as well as fragments of the LXXII "canto" (honouring the recently deceased <a href="Filippo%20Tommaso%20Marinetti">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</a>) and the entire LXXIII "canto" (celebrating a girl from <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a> who porpusefully led a squad of Allied soldiers about to occupy <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a> into a <a href="minefield">minefield</a>, at the cost of her own life) of his "Cantos". Pound published his last article on "Marina Repubblicana" on April 1, 1945. Four days later, the disenchanted Degli Uberti reportedly remarked ""Here those who die make a bargain"".

On 26 April 1945 some men of the "Pegaso" Battalion of <a href="Decima%20Flottiglia%20MAS">Decima Flottiglia MAS</a>, guarding the Undersecretariat of the National Republican Navy in Montecchio Maggiore, intervened to prevent the looting of the battalion's warehouse by the local population, but in doing so they were attacked by a small retreating German unit, made up of <a href="Osttruppen">Russian volunteers</a>, who had mistaken them for enemies. During the clash the car of Admiral Degli Uberti arrived and was ordered to halt, but when he was about to get out of the car the Russians opened fire, mortally wounding him. He was carried to a nearby hospital, where he died shortly thereafter. He was buried in Vicenza.

More recently his poem "The Resolute Courtier" was included in "The Centuries' Poetry 2 - Donne to Dryden". He was very much of his time:

<poem>"Prithee, say aye or no;
"If thou’lt not have me, tell me so;
"I cannot stay,
"Then I am thine, or else I am mine own."</poem>

Shipman was born in <a href="Scarrington">Scarrington</a> near <a href="Newark-on-Trent">Newark-on-Trent</a> and educated at <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>. His work shows him to have been an outspoken royalist, but he managed to keep his family estate intact between the <a href="Execution%20of%20Charles%20I">execution of Charles I</a> in 1649 and the <a href="Stuart%20Restoration">Stuart restoration</a> in 1660 by retiring from public life. In his preface to "Carolina" Flatman comments: ""In the Calamities of the last Rebellion he was no small Sharer, the Iniquity of the Times having no power to shock his Loyalty, he very cheerfully underwent the Tryals of unhappy Virtue."" 

Shipman's heroic tragedy "Henry the Third of France" was performed at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> in 1678. It was written to support the <a href="James%20Scott%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Monmouth">Duke of Monmouth</a> at a time when <a href="Popish%20Plot">anti-Catholic hysteria</a> gripped the country. (Monmouth later led the disastrous <a href="Monmouth%20Rebellion">Monmouth Rebellion</a> in an effort to depose his Catholic uncle <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> and was executed in 1685.) In his preface to "Carolina" Flatman comments again: ""If there be any thing meaner than may be expected from so polite a Pen, thy Candor must attribute it either to the hasty Efforts of his younger, or the too ponderous and over-pow'ring Confusions which the Rebellion imprinted on his riper Years."" 

Shipman died at Scarrington, where he was buried on 15 October 1680.

Youth word of the year (Germany)

The Youth word of the year (German: Jugendwort des Jahres) is an annual publication which reviews trends in <a href="German%20youth%20language">German youth language</a> and names one new or recently popularized word as the most noteworthy. The winning word is chosen by a jury under the guidance of publishing company <a href="Langenscheidt">Langenscheidt</a>, who specializes in language reference works. The competition has run since 2008, but no word was announced in 2019.

The competition stands in the tradition of assessments of a <a href="word%20of%20the%20year">word of the year</a>, the longest-running being the selection of the <a href="Word%20of%20the%20year%20%28Germany%29">German word of the year</a> by the <a href="Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20deutsche%20Sprache">Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache</a> (GfdS), which has been announced annually since 1977.

Section::::Selection process.
The public is invited to nominate words online, which are then narrowed down in a multi-step process. The jury has the final say over the winner and the runners-up; until 2020 there was no public voting and no formal inclusion of young people in the process. The criteria applied to the nominated words include "linguistic creativity", "originality", "degree of proliferation", and "societal and cultural events".

Section::::History.
The selection of the youth word of the year is part of an annual publicity campaign for Langenscheidt's "100 Prozent Jugendsprache" ("100 percent Youth Language"), a dictionary of new and old expressions used by German-speaking young people. After Langenscheidt was bought by publisher Pons in spring 2019, no youth word of the year was announced for that year, since the accompanying dictionary was not deemed to be ready. After some uncertainty about the future of the competition, 2020 saw a new edition of the youth word of the year, with the winning entry being decided in an online vote for the first time.

Section::::Criticism and discussion.
A common criticism of the competition to find the "youth word of the year" is that is merely an elaborate advertising campaign for publisher Langenscheidt. Critics have also doubted whether the selected words are actually used by young people, especially since they are not the only group which can nominate words, but rather users of all age groups.

The <a href="Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20deutsche%20Sprache">Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache</a> called the competition a "nice idea". But GfdS' Lutz Kuntzsch added that he considered it "playing with language", and that he would not expect young people to actually use all or any of the nominated words.

Wolfgang Gaiser of the German Youth Institute, a social science research center in Munich, criticised that "this is more about a publisher's marketing than social science about how young people speak and think. Using such shenanigans to generate attention for publications and find new readers is a clever marketing gag. [...] Wenn silly phrases are given center stage, and it is implied that this represents the level of speech and thought of today's youth, then this paints a distorted picture."

Section::::2009.
The word "hartzen" was criticized for implying that unemployed people were lazy and were voluntarily living at the expense of the state.

Section::::2015.
The phrase "Alpha-Kevin" as an expression of "the dumbest of all people" (referencing the phenomenon of <a href="Kevinism">Kevinism</a>, a German prejudice against persons with certain trendy names) was removed from the competition, because the jury felt it was discriminatory against real persons with the name. Additionally, journalists doubted that the word "Smombie" had seen actual usage, given that no mentions prior to the competition could be found, and a large majority of young people had never heard of it. Critics speculated that the word could be an invention of Langenscheidt.

Section::::2020.
After Langenscheidt had decided to not crown a youth word of the year in 2019, the competition returned in 2020. The publisher had responded to criticism by giving more power to online users in the process. The publisher accepted nominations via its website, and the winning entry (the English word "lost") was decided by online voting for the first time, rather than purely through a jury vote.

A minor controversy hinged on the nomination of the word "Hurensohn" ("son of a whore"), which was suggested en masse by the users of a German-language community on <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a>. The word had been part of a popular <a href="meme">meme</a> about speaking German. Responding to the flood of nominations, Langenscheid stated that "Hurensohn" had been disqualified from the process because they would not consider expletives and slurs. However, the word was slated for inclusion in that year's annual dictionary of youth language.

Jules Wright (politician)

Jules Winslow Wright (born 1933) is an American politician from Alaska.

Section::::Early life and private sector.
Jules Wright was born in <a href="Nenana%2C%20Alaska">Nenana, Alaska</a>, in 1933, and attended the local schools. He had seven siblings, including Gareth and <a href="Don%20Wright%20%28politician%29">Don</a>. When Jules Wright was approximately 13, his father died, leaving the family business, Wright Truck and Tractor, to his wife and three youngest sons. Jules Wright finished his education in <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>, graduating from <a href="Lathrop%20High%20School%20%28Alaska%29">Fairbanks High School</a>. He remained in Fairbanks as a trucker for two years before serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. During his military service, Wright was stationed in Fairbanks. After leaving the army, Wright ran a construction business with his brothers, then started another company, Tundra Contracting, in 1966. Subsequently, he was involved in the mining industry for a decade, then built and operated the Manley Hot Springs Resort for eight years. By 1993, Wright was an employment rights officer for the Tanana Chiefs Conference.

Section::::Political career.
Wright became involved with the Fairbanks Native Association around 1963, and served as its president before his election to the <a href="Alaska%20House%20of%20Representatives">Alaska House of Representatives</a>. As the leader of the association, Wright helped develop and present a proposal to regarding dormitories for <a href="Alaskan%20Native">Alaskan Native</a> children to the <a href="Alaska%20Legislature">Alaska Legislature</a>'s Health, Welfare and Education Committee in February 1966, which led to his decision to mount a campaign of his own later that year. His 1966 run for public office was described as a "strong person-to-person" campaign. During his single term as a state representative, Wright was affiliated with the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> and also served on the first convocation of a statewide land claims task force. Wright did not seek reelection to the state house during the 1968 election cycle. During his tenure, Wright voted against a bill regarding mergers of cities and boroughs that ultimately passed the state house in March 1967. That same month, a bill regarding registration of voters passed the Alaska Senate. Prior to the lower house's vote on the legislation, Wright declared his opposition to it. In April, the state house defeated the voter registration bill, with Wright voting against its passage. In February 1968, Wright criticized a bill that would define alcoholism as a disease, and protect alcoholics from criminal charges, fearing that its implementation would lead more people to become alcoholics. Later that month, Wright expressed opposition to a bill sponsored by <a href="Don%20Young">Don Young</a> to establish a statewide grain incentive program.

In 1976, Wright ran for the <a href="Alaska%20Senate">Alaska Senate</a> as an independent. Jules Wright's campaign was significantly financed by his brother Lawrence Wright, also of Tundra Contracting. The unsuccessful campaign was subject to a fine of $60 for turning its financial report in late. In 1984, Jules Wright contested an <a href="open%20primary">open primary</a> as a Republican candidate from <a href="Manley%20Hot%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Manley Hot Springs, Alaska</a>, losing his bid to return to the state house.

Section::::Critical reception.
"<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" thought that "Shudder hasn't sacrificed any of its cleverness, but it has added a little bit of soul, which is what makes this the band's most compelling album." "<a href="Guitar%20Player">Guitar Player</a>" wrote that "the band forgets about punk credibility and lets guitarist Nathan Larson fashion the kind of gleaming pop-metal hooks that his gutsy playing has always hinted at." "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" opined that "for fully half the tracks on this album, Wedren's voice could not unfairly be compared to that of Journey's Steve Perry." "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" declared that "'Beauty Strike' is the perfect Shudder to Think song, rushing at breakneck speed round unpredictable musical blind corners, an irresistible melody nailed to its back bumper, but the album is eventually marooned in a swamp of lumpy metallic riffing." "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" wrote that the album "has real fibre, a depth and passion that's rare in guitar power rock." 

<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called the album "the kind of eclectic post-punk that will primarily appeal to critics and record collectors."

Tristram was born in <a href="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a>, then in <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, the only child of Oliver and Elsie Tristram. The family moved to <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a> in 1925, when Tristram was aged 8, where he was educated at <a href="Reading%20School">Reading School</a>. Despite an early ambition to become a <a href="Pianist">concert pianist</a>, he decided to become an <a href="organist">organist</a>, gaining his ARCO aged 16 and his FRCO the following year – the youngest in the country at the time. <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> meant he was unable to take up his scholarship to the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, though he took lessons from Dr <a href="G.%20D.%20Cunningham">G. D. Cunningham</a> at <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, and worked for the <a href="Post%20Office%20Ltd">Post Office</a> during the war. Subsequently moving to <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, he became articled to an <a href="estate%20agent">estate agent</a>'s firm, and played the organ at All Saints', <a href="Southbourne%2C%20Dorset">Southbourne</a>.
Section::::Christchurch Priory.
Tristram was appointed <a href="Organist%20and%20master%20of%20the%20choristers">Organist and Master of the Choristers</a> of <a href="Christchurch%20Priory">Christchurch Priory</a>, <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> in 1949 – a post he held until his death 30 years later. The position came with a residence, the <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> house 'Church Hatch' next door to the Priory, where Tristram enjoyed hosting musicians, foreign students, events and parties for the duration of the time he was resident there.

After <a href="John%20Compton%20%28organ%20builder%29">Compton</a> rebuilt the Priory organ in 1951, Tristram started summer series of weekly organ recitals, given by many famous names, such as <a href="Francis%20Jackson%20%28composer%29">Francis Jackson</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Campbell">Sidney Campbell</a>, as well as beginners and, particuarly, himself. Several new stops were added to the organ in 1964, though it remained caseless and became unserviceable in the 1970s, leading to the installation of a 4-manual digital organ which was of high enough quality to be used for recitals and broadcasts. The pipe organ was eventually rebuilt and a case added by <a href="Nicholson%20%26amp%3B%20Co%20Ltd">Nicholson</a> in 1999.

From the modest group of singers that constituted the Priory choir when he arrived in 1949, Tristram created a choir of 14 men and 20 boys which was fine enough to regularly broadcast <a href="Choral%20Evensong%20%28BBC%29">Choral Evensong</a> on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> and tour internationally.

Section::::Recitalist and broadcaster.
Tristram was most celebrated as a performer, both as a solo organist and as an accompanist, and was well-known for his recitals and broadcasts even before he was appointed to the Priory. According to the <a href="BBC%20Genome%20Project">BBC Genome Project</a>, Tristram participated in the region of 80 BBC broadcasts as a soloist, accompanist or conductor.

Vickers House

The Vickers House, on <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%2015">Louisiana Highway 15</a> in the rural <a href="Richland%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Richland Parish, Louisiana</a> community of <a href="Alto%2C%20Louisiana">Alto, Louisiana</a>, was built around 1870. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1986.

It is <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> in style; its gallery along the front of the house has six <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan order</a> columns.

Its interior woodwork of mantels and doors, etc., is almost all <a href="false-grained">false-grained</a> (painted to resemble wood grain).

It is significant as the most important historical architectural work in Richland Parish. As noted in 1986 the house:is easily the most important historic building known to exist in Richland Parish. No survey exists for the parish, but the State Historic Preservation Office staff is familiar with the area, having tried on and off for several years to, find Register eligible properties. (Until recently Richland was the only parish without a Register listing.) The parish's patrimony is characterized almost entirely by ordinary bungalows, plain cottages, and pedestrian commercial buildings. The only known exceptions are two early twentieth century bank buildings and the Vickers House. Taken within this context, the Vickers House is of immense architectural importance on the local level. It is the parish's only intact example of the Greek Revival style. (The only other example is a very plain, greatly altered country Greek Revival church.) The Vickers House is also a noteworthy Greek Revival residence for reasons other than rarity. Its impressive front gallery, <a href="aedicule">aedicule</a> motif <a href="fenestration%20%28architecture%29">fenestration</a>, false graining, and overall intactness would establish it as an important example in any parish in northern Louisiana, and most certainly in Richland Parish.

Sakurajima (novella)

Section::::Plot.
During the last weeks of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, naval <a href="Non-commissioned%20officer">NCO</a> and <a href="Cryptography">crypto specialist</a> Murakami, stationed in <a href="Minamisatsuma">Bonotsu</a>, receives a marching order to <a href="Sakurajima">Sakurajima</a>. On his way, in a village near <a href="Makurazaki%2C%20Kagoshima">Makurazaki</a>, he spends the night with a young disfigured prostitute who has only one ear. Convinced that Murakami will die in combat, she asks him what he thinks how he will die, a question that stays with him.

Murakami arrives in Sakurajima, a military post awaiting the imminent invasion of American troops and the launch base of <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> flights. Personally in doubt that Japan can still win the war, Murakami is confronted with disillusioned soldiers, roistering young kamikaze pilots, and rigid commanding officer Kira, who forbids any defeatist thoughts. He has repeated conversations with an elderly guard, who tells him of a near-by farm where a disabled old man is being picked on by his relatives. During a carousing night, Murakami hears of the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">bombing of Hiroshima</a> and Russia's invasion of the Japanese mainland. He gets into an argument with the drunken Kira, who ridicules Murakami's wish for a "beautiful death".

The next day, a low-flying aircraft attacks the island, misses Murakami but kills the elderly guard. After this incident, no further enemy planes are spotted. Murakami joins a group of men who have been ordered to burn those codebooks which are no longer needed. Upon his return to the shelter, he learns that the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> has declared Japan's defeat. Kira draws his sword as if to commit suicide, but eventually retracts.

Section::::Publication history.
"Sakurajima" was first published in September 1946 in the magazine "Sunao" (素直), which was edited by poet and social activist Shin'ichi Eguchi. The story was based on Umezaki's own experiences, who, like the main character Murakami, was stationed in <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> as a crypto specialist, although Umezaki later emphasised that the first person narrator was as much an invention and fictional as the other characters. The novella established Umezaki as a representative of Japanese postwar literature along writers like <a href="Hiroshi%20Noma">Hiroshi Noma</a> and <a href="Rinz%C5%8D%20Shiina">Rinzō Shiina</a>.

Section::::Translation.
"Sakurajima" was translated into English by D.E. Mills and appeared in the 1966 anthology "The Shadow of Sunrise: Selected Stories of Japan and the War" and its slightly altered 1981 reprint "The Catch and Other War Stories".

The Terminator (Sega CD video game)

The Terminator is a 1993 <a href="Platform%20game">platform</a> <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> game developed and published by <a href="Virgin%20Interactive">Virgin Games</a> for the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a>. It is based on the 1984 <a href="The%20Terminator">film of the same name</a>, and includes <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> from the film. The game was praised for its graphics and its soundtrack composed by <a href="Tommy%20Tallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a>, although the film footage was considered low quality. The gameplay also received some criticism.

Section::::Gameplay.
"The Terminator" is a <a href="Platform%20game">platform</a> <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> game. It includes 10 levels. Playing as soldier <a href="Kyle%20Reese">Kyle Reese</a>, the player travels through a <a href="Skynet%20%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a> facility during the first four levels, set in 2029. After battling Skynet's <a href="Terminator%20%28character%20concept%29">Terminator machines</a>, Kyle finds a time machine and travels to Los Angeles 1984, where the remainder of the game takes place. Kyle locates <a href="Sarah%20Connor%20%28Terminator%29">Sarah Connor</a> and protects her from the <a href="Terminator%20%28character%29">Terminator</a>, a machine sent from the future by Skynet. The Terminator is tasked with killing Sarah, preventing her future son <a href="John%20Connor">John Connor</a> from leading the human resistance against Skynet. The player can use various weapons and has unlimited ammunition. The player can crouch, jump, and shoot in multiple directions.

Section::::Development and release.
Although the game is based on the film, creative license was taken to give more variation in the gameplay. The graphics and music took advantage of the Sega CD's capabilities, and the game includes the use of digitized <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> (FMV) from the film. The FMV scenes appear in between levels to advance the story.

The game also utilized <a href="QSound">QSound</a>. The soundtrack was composed by <a href="Tommy%20Tallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a>, and it includes hard rock, pop and techno music. Tallarico said the game's graphics "were still very much 16-bit-looking and the music you'd hear would be like music on the radio or on an album – and it was a bit jarring. So I would get into screaming matches with the producers because they told me they didn't want that proper music in the game. They said it doesn't sound like a videogame and I said exactly – it doesn't have to any more!"

"The Terminator" was originally scheduled for release in June 1993, but was delayed because of changes at Virgin. It was released six months later than initially scheduled.

Section::::Reception.
"The Terminator" was praised for its graphics and its inclusion of FMV, although the latter was also criticized for its poor quality. Paul Pettengale of "<a href="Sega%20Power">Sega Power</a>" wrote, "The images are so grainy, and the colours so fuzzy, looking too hard at these bits could be bad for your eyes". The soundtrack was praised. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" stated that the "catchy music fits the action well".

Some reviewers were critical of the gameplay. Julian Connolly of "<a href="MegaTech">MegaTech</a>" felt that the game had no longterm value, concluding that it "looks great, sounds great, plays great for a while but all this shooting wears you down". Pettengale found the gameplay unoriginal and wrote "not even a superb soundtrack can save a game when it's had so little thought put into it". Paul Mellerick of "<a href="Mega%20%28magazine%29">Mega</a>" was disappointed by the linear level design and concluded, "A well-presented blast, but ultimately boring, very samey and a bit of a waste". David Roberts of "<a href="Sega%20Zone">Sega Zone</a>" found the game to be lacking variety. "<a href="Game%20Players">Game Players</a>" considered it an average platform game.

In a later review for <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>, Shawn Sackenheim praised the "bleak" and "dreary" graphics, stating that they "lend themselves nicely to the mood of the game". He also praised Tallarico's score, writing that it added "a ton to the impact of the graphics and the mood of each level". Sackenheim concluded, "While it may not have been the best looking action/platformer around, it could definitely give any other game a run for its money". "<a href="Jeuxvideo">Jeuxvideo</a>" reviewed the game in 2010, praising the soundtrack and controls.

VAE (vehicle)

The Vehículo Anfibio de Exploración (VAE, "Amphibious Exploration Vehicle") was an <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a> project developed by <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> in the 1970s.

Section::::History.
The production of armored vehicles in Argentina ceased after the production of 16 <a href="Nahuel%20DL%2043">Nahuel</a> tanks in 1940. In 1960, "Plan Europa" was formulated, planning for the development of armored vehicles production in Argentina. In 1968, under license from French firms, <a href="AMX-13">AMX-13</a> light tanks were manufactured at the <a href="Astarsa">Astarsa</a> shipyard. By the 1970s, Argentina had become the second largest arms producer in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> (after <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>), producing equipment such as ships, military aircraft and rifles, and the government was attempting to produce its own armored vehicles. In 1974, the <a href="West%20Germany">West German</a> firm <a href="Thyssen-Henschel">Thyssen-Henschel</a> received a contract for the development of the medium tank <a href="Tanque%20Argentino%20Mediano">TAM</a> and the <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a> . In January 1979, the state-owned company ordered the French companies <a href="Renault">Renault</a> and <a href="Panhard">Panhard</a> to build prototypes of a wheeled armored personnel carrier for the <a href="Argentine%20Army">Argentine Army</a>. Panhard worked with the Argentine company Talleres Electromecánicos Norte S. A. (TENSA) and Renault with Astilleros Argentinos Río de la Plata S. A. The <a href="reconnaissance%20vehicle">reconnaissance vehicle</a> <a href="VAPE">Vehículo Anfibio Pesado de Exploración</a> (VAPE), was also developed concurrently by the two companies.

The contract called for the construction of 1000 units, to be assembled at the factory of TENSA in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina">Córdoba</a>. The Renault VAE (VAE 1) was the first to be presented, being built on the basis of Renault's own <a href="V%C3%A9hicule%20de%20l%27Avant%20Blind%C3%A9">VAB</a>. Panhard later presented their own prototype, VAE 2. The prototypes were then tested on rugged, mountainous and swampy areas. While the tests were successful, the military dictatorship of the <a href="National%20Reorganization%20Process">National Reorganization Process</a> was then involved in the <a href="Dirty%20War">Dirty War</a>, and financial difficulties caused the discontinuation of the project.

Section::::Design and specifications.
At the time, Argentina did not have a developed road network and required fast, lightweight military equipment. The VAE/VAPE, along with the TAM/VCTP and the plane <a href="DINFIA%20IA%2038">DINFIA IA 38</a>, was developed with this in mind. This allowed VAE to be easily transportable by air in a military cargo aircraft. VAE was designed to transport men to the battlefield while protecting them from gunfire of up to 7.62 mm caliber and from landmines, with armor on the bottom and sides of the armored vehicle.

The steel armor is bulletproof and splinter-proof, and the vehicle is equipped with <a href="CBRN%20defense">NBC protection</a>, air conditioning and fire extinguishers. In addition to the crew of three, one of whom is the operator of the turret weapons, the vehicle is capable of transporting 10 fully equipped infantrymen. The 900 kg turret is located behind the engine compartment in the center of the hull.

The VAE is equipped with a 20mm <a href="Rheinmetall%20Mk%2020%20Rh-202">Rheinmetall Rh-202</a> gun located in the FL20 turret produced by <a href="Creusot-Loire">Creusot-Loire</a>. The ammunition stock is 130 rounds. In addition, the vehicle has two 7.62 mm machine guns with 1000 rounds.

George Leitch

George Leitch ( – May 1907) was an English actor-manager and dramatist who had a substantial career in Australia.

Section::::History.
Born George Ralf Walker in London, Leitch was educated and trained as a civil engineer, following in his family's footsteps. He did some work in this line in the coal-mining districts of <a href="South%20Staffordshire">South Staffordshire</a>, but he was a comic at heart and longed to go on the stage. His first foray in the field was unfortunate, as the company in which he was playing failed, but he dared not go back to the family with his tail between his legs. By a stroke of luck he was able to join a Shakespearean company by taking the place of a man named Leitch, and hence his stage name. This company also failed, disappearing with their costumes and <a href="theatrical%20property">props</a> before they could be seized by the <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a>s. 
His first real engagement was with <a href="Charles%20Alexander%20Calvert">Charles Calvert</a> at the <a href="Prince%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Manchester">Prince's Theatre, Manchester</a>, which lasted several years, and his work was complimented by <a href="Ilma%20de%20Murska">Ilma de Murska</a>.
He became a stock comedian at <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, playing alongside many of the stars of the day — <a href="Sims%20Reeves">Sims Reeves</a>, <a href="Charles%20James%20Mathews">Charles Matthews</a>, <a href="Barry%20Sullivan%20%28stage%20actor%29">Barry Sullivan</a>, <a href="John%20Lawrence%20Toole">John Lawrence Toole</a>, <a href="Walter%20Montgomery%20%28actor%29">Walter Montgomery</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Neilson">Adelaide Neilson</a>, <a href="Ada%20Cavendish">Ada Cavendish</a>, to mention a few.
His first appearance in London was at the Standard Theatre, as Rene in "<a href="The%20Two%20Orphans%20%28play%29">The Two Orphans</a>", with <a href="William%20Rignold">William Rignold</a> and the Olympic company.
His first <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> appearance was in "<a href="The%20Shaughraun">The Shaughraun</a>" at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> as a replacement for <a href="Dion%20Boucicault">Dion Boucicault</a> when the great actor was called away urgently, and <a href="F.%20B.%20Chatterton">F. B. Chatterton</a>, who had only met Leitch briefly, gave him his big chance.

Section::::Writer and producer.
Leitch contributed articles to the Manchester "Courier", whose editor Allen gave him much encouragement, and it was in Manchester and Liverpool that he wrote his play "Sithors to Grind", which he produced in London two years later, receiving warm reviews from <a href="John%20Oxenford">John Oxenford</a> of "The Times".
He formed a company to tour "Sithors to Grind", and other original plays: "The Improvisatore", based on <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s autobiographical novel, "Uncle Zac", "The Coming D - -", "Money Down", "A Touch of the Sun", "Old Times", and "Those Girls". In Australia he would write "Wanda" for the Majeronis, "Pearl Diver", "The Librarian" (adapted from <a href="Gustav%20von%20Moser">Gustav von Moser</a>'s "Der Bibliothekar"), "The Madman", and an adaptation of <a href="T.%20A.%20Browne">T. A. Browne</a>'s "<a href="For%20the%20Term%20of%20His%20Natural%20Life">For the Term of His Natural Life</a>" which he finished writing in Hobart, having visited some of the places in which it was set.
Possibly his last work, "The Land of the Moa", was largely written in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in 1895, and was revived in that country on many occasions.

Section::::Australia.
He brought "Sithors to Grind" to Australia, playing first at the <a href="Princess%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne">Princess Theatre, Melbourne</a> under contract to <a href="Williamson%2C%20Garner%20and%20Musgrove">Williamson, Garner and Musgrove</a>. When that combination disbanded Leitch joined Musgrove's comic opera company, playing at the <a href="Melbourne%20Opera%20House">Melbourne Opera House</a>.

In December 1884 Leitch went into partnership with "the indefatigable little <a href="George%20MacMahon%20%28theatre%29">George MacMahon</a>" and his brother <a href="James%20MacMahon">James</a>, taking a lease on the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Hobart">Theatre Royal, Hobart</a>. He brought the <a href="Eduardo%20Majeroni">Majeronis</a> to Hobart and secured rights to "Called Back", <a href="Joseph%20Derrick">Joseph Derrick</a>'s "Confusion", "The Private Secretary", "Youth" by <a href="Paul%20Merritt">Merritt</a> and <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Harriss</a>, <a href="G.%20R.%20Sims">G. R. Sims</a>'s "Lights o' London", "Moths".

They toured Australia's eastern States and New Zealand with "<a href="The%20Silver%20King%20%28play%29">The Silver King</a>" 1885–1886.
During the tour they brought out "His Natural Life", a stage version of <a href="T.%20A.%20Browne">T. A. Browne</a>'s novel "For the Term of His Natural Life", which opened on 26 April 1886 at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Brisbane">Theatre Royal, Brisbane</a>, followed by Adelaide 29 May 1886, Sydney 5 June 1886, Melbourne 26 June 1886.
The MacMahon Leitch Company disbanded in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> at the end of their New Zealand tour and the principals took a holiday in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>. They then successfully sued <a href="Wellington%20Evening%20Post">Wellington Evening Post</a> and the Press Association for publishing a report implying they had left <a href="Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Hamilton</a> with debts unpaid.

He suffered an accident while playing <a href="G.%20R.%20Sims">Sims</a> and <a href="Henry%20Pettitt">Pettitt</a>'s "Harbor Lights" in Ballarat, January 1889, and with consequent illness took many months to recover.

He joined the Nellie Stewart Opera Company in 1890, playing "Petit Pierre", "The Insect" in <a href="Henry%20Brougham%20Farnie">Farnie</a>'s "<a href="Surcouf%20%28op%C3%A9ra%20comique%29">Paul Jones</a>" as a foil to <a href="G.%20H.%20Snazelle">G. H. Snazelle</a>'s Bouillabaisse, their song "Two Mariners Bold" being memorable.

He was in New Zealand early in 1895 working on a new play, "<a href="The%20Land%20of%20the%20Moa">The Land of the Moa</a>", which opened 24 July 1895 at the <a href="Wellington%20Opera%20House">Wellington Opera House</a>, and was well received, then toured through Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin before being first staged in Sydney on 19 October at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Sydney">Theatre Royal</a>.

Leitch left Australia around June 1897. There was no announcement, no farewell.

Oak Knoll Park

Oak Knoll Park is a municipal park in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Missouri">Clayton, Missouri</a>, a suburb of <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>. Founded in 1958, it includes 14.5 acres of land that host one of the largest native stands of <a href="Quercus%20stellata">post oak</a> trees. It also includes two early 20th-century stone mansions.

In 1958, the Clayton <a href="Alderman">Board of Aldermen</a> authorized the purchase of a 21-acre tract of land at the northwest corner of Clayton Road and Big Bend Boulevard. City planners had recommended a purchase of land for the city's second municipal park, after <a href="Shaw%20Park%2C%20Clayton">Shaw Park</a>, and this tract was deemed the only suitable candidate. Voters approved a $350,000 bond issue a few months later, and the land was ultimately purchased for $400,000. The tract included two stone mansions of about 20 rooms apiece, both built by prominent St. Louisans of their day: 1 Oak Knoll, built by Charles M. Rice and recently vacated by his widow, and 2 Oak Knoll, built by Alvin D. Goldman and then occupied by his widow, Blanche Lesser Goldman.

Oak Knoll Park was for several decades the site of the St. Louis <a href="Museum%20of%20Science%20and%20Natural%20History">Museum of Science and Natural History</a>, an operation of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Science%2C%20St.%20Louis">Academy of Science, St. Louis</a>. In 1959, the academy installed part of its collection, by then a century old, in the park's mansions. The academy paid just $1 per year in rent, but was responsible for upkeep on the buildings. The museum, which was free to enter, was immediately popular with the public, but within a few years, the academy was struggling to fund its maintenance. Similar funding problems with the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Zoo">Saint Louis Zoo</a> and the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Art%20Museum">Saint Louis Art Museum</a> led city leaders in 1969 to propose a tax levy to support all three institutions. When voters approved the levy in 1971, control of the museum and its collection passed to a Board of Commissioners. The museum was eventually closed and part of the collection was transferred to the new <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Science%20Center">St. Louis Science Center</a>, which opened in 1992.

In 2021, Clayton leaders announced that renovation of the pond area would be funded by a $150,000 gift.

Land and Titles Court of Samoa

The Land and Titles Court of Samoa is a specialist court dealing with <a href="Fa%CA%BBamatai">Matai titles</a> and customary land in <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>.

The Court was originally established in 1903 under the <a href="German%20Samoa">German colonial administration</a> as a Land Commission. It was continued under the New Zealand colonial administration, and formally became a <a href="court%20of%20record">court of record</a> in 1934, though it was not renamed until 1937. It was continued by part IX of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Samoa">Constitution of Samoa</a>, which provided it with "such composition and with such jurisdiction in relation to Matai titles and customary land as may be provided by Act". Colonial law governing the Court was repealed in 1981, and replaced with the "Land and Titles Act 1981".

The Court consists of a President, who must be qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court or as a Samoan Judge, and a number of Samoan Judges and Assessors, who must be qualified "by reason of character, ability, standing and reputation". Judges are appointed by the Head of State on the advice of the Judicial Services Commission, and serve until they reach the age of 65 years, but can be removed from office for inability or misbehaviour.

Section::::Jurisdiction.
Under the "Land and Titles Act 1981" it has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters relating to Samoan names and titles, the rights and obligations of title-holders, the interpretation of custom and customary usage, and over disputes relating to <a href="customary%20land">customary land</a>. Under section 11 of the <a href="Village%20Fono%20Act%201990">Village Fono Act 1990</a> it is an appeals court for the decisions of village councils. Originally the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Samoa">Supreme Court of Samoa</a> exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the Court by way of <a href="judicial%20review">judicial review</a> for conformity with fundamental human rights, but this was removed in 2020 by the <a href="Land%20and%20Titles%20Bill">Land and Titles Bill</a>.

Parties must make genuine efforts to resolve a dispute before appearing before the court, and the Court may order customary reconciliation or any other dispute resolution process.

The court decides cases by customary Samoan law, and any Act expressed to apply to the Court.

Section::::Controversy.
In April 2019 the then-President of the Court, <a href="Fepulea%27i%20Attila%20Ropati">Fepulea'i Attila Ropati</a>, was convicted of intentionally causing bodily harm for smashing a bottle of the head of a security guard. The <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Samoa">Legislative Assembly of Samoa</a> subsequently refused to remove him from office. In September 2019 Deputy President <a href="Sevealii%20Panapa%20Vee">Sevealii Panapa Vee</a>, Senior Judge <a href="Lavea%20Siaosi%20Hazelman">Lavea Siaosi Hazelman</a> and Judge <a href="Nanai%20Pologa%20Ioane">Nanai Pologa Ioane</a> were suspended from office following an investigation by the Judicial Services Commission.

Bertazzoni

Bertazzoni S.p.A. is an Italian <a href="home%20appliance">home appliance</a> manufacturer based in <a href="Guastalla">Guastalla</a>. Founded in 1882 by Francesco Bertazzoni, the company has since been led by five generations of the Bertazzoni family. The company originally produced wood-burning stoves which were discontinued in the 1980s. It began producing <a href="Gas%20stove">gas stoves</a> in 1956, adding <a href="Electric%20stove">electric stoves</a> in 1975, and <a href="Induction%20hob">induction cooktops</a> in 2005.

Bertazzoni's appliances are based on designs, and produced in colors, inspired by the <a href="automotive%20industry%20in%20Italy">automotive industry in Italy</a>. Besides ovens and cooktops, the company also markets refrigerators, dishwashers and a number of other kitchen appliances. The company markets its products in more than 60 countries including Australia, Canada, the Philippines, and the United States.

Section::::History.
Bertazzoni was founded by Francesco Bertazzoni in 1882 in <a href="Guastalla">Guastalla</a>, Italy. The company has been led by successive generations of the Bertazzoni family with Francesco's son, Antonio Bertazzoni, succeeding him in the early 20th century followed by Napoleone Bertazzoni. The company opened its first factory in 1909 with construction partly financed by Napoleone's wife, Angela Bonfanti, the daughter of an affluent cheesemaker in <a href="Novellara">Novellera</a>. 
Napoleone had previously worked in the Turin automotive industry and introduced mass production to Bertazzoni in the 1920s. In 1923, the company adopted the Fratelli Bertazzoni brand name and logo. Three years later, Bertazzoni was accredited by the Reggio Emilia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The company used the slogan "In Every Home" () to heavily promote its La Germania ovens during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>.

Napoleone Bertazzoni died in 1939. After the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Bonfanti took out a loan to buy out the business from her in-laws and family to gain full ownership of the company with her two daughters and four sons. The youngest among them was Francesco Bertazzoni who succeeded his mother in leading the company in the mid-1900s.

Bertazzoni introduced its first gas cooking ovens in 1956 but continued to produce wood burning stoves into the 1980s. The first electric oven was introduced in 1975, and <a href="Induction%20hob">induction cooktops</a> in 2005.

Bertazzoni continues to operate as a family business. Paolo Bertazzoni began working for the company in 1981. He became the fifth-generation CEO and president of Bertazzoni in 1999. His sister Elisabetta is on the board of directors. Paolo's daughter Valentina and son Nicola also hold top level positions in the company. Beginning in the early 2000s, the company adopted the <a href="Toyota%20Production%20System">Toyota Production System</a>, whereby production level was dictated by actual demand in the market rather than available production capacity.

Section::::Operations.
Bertazzoni's manufacturing facilities remain in Guastalla where the company opened its main showroom, Casa Bertazzoni, in 2016. The company first began exporting its appliances to <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, Philippines, in 1959–1960, and then licensed a manufacturer to produce Bertazzoni's La Germania appliances locally. Since then, three generations of a Filipino family have been in partnership with Bertazzoni to continue production under the license agreement. In the 1990s, Bertazzoni entered the Middle Eastern market with large ovens designed specifically for the cuisine of the region.

Bertazzoni began distributing its products in the United States in 2005. Some of its ovens were redesigned to increase their size to accommodate large <a href="Turkey%20as%20food">turkeys</a> traditionally served on <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving in the United States</a>. By 2007, Bertazzoni products were sold a total of more than 60 countries. By 2012, the U.S. was the single largest market for Bertazzoni appliances. 

In 2011, Bertazzoni began featuring touch screen controls in its ovens which included software automated cooking modes. As of 2012, Bertazzoni ovens come in eight bright colors, including the two most popular colors: yellow and red inspired by luxury Italian sports cars.

Since 2015, Bertazzoni markets its appliances in a series of four design categories; the Professional Series are engineered toward a professional culinary industry standard with <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> throughout; the Master Series offers an industrial design for at-home use; the Modern Series has simple contemporary designs with glass and oxidized sheet metal; and the Heritage series offers a traditional decor style.

Judo in Manitoba

The Japanese martial art and combat sport <a href="judo">judo</a> has been practised in the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> since the 1940s. 

Section::::History.
Judo was <a href="Judo%20in%20Canada">introduced to Canada</a> in the early twentieth century by Japanese <a href="Immigration">migrants</a>, and was limited to <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> until the forced <a href="Internment%20of%20Japanese%20Canadians">expulsion, internment, and resettlement of Japanese-Canadians</a> after Japan entered the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> in 1941. Japanese Canadian expulsion and internment was pivotal in the development of Canadian judo because it forced judoka to settle in other parts of the country. Some returned to the Pacific coast after 1949, but most found new homes in other provinces. New dojos opened in the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">Prairies</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, and <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, primarily in the mid-to-late 1940s, and the centre of Canadian judo shifted from Vancouver to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, where a significant number of judoka had settled after the war. Many early dojos were housed at the local branch of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, which also provided short-term accommodation, assisted with finding employment, and coordinated social programs for resettled Japanese Canadians. Clubs at <a href="Military%20base">military bases</a>, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">RCMP</a> barracks, and <a href="University">universities</a> were also common.

Glen and George Pridmore, two brothers and police officers from the <a href="St.%20James-Assiniboia%2C%20Winnipeg">St. James</a> area of <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, started a nominal judo club at the Central YMCA in 1937, but they reportedly taught a mix of <a href="jujutsu">jujutsu</a> and other <a href="Hand-to-hand%20combat">unarmed combat</a> techniques and called it 'judo' because it was a popular term at the time. The club appears to have closed at some point and then reopened in 1947. Tomatsu "Tom" Mitani, who was born in Japan and moved from British Columbia to <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> to avoid internment in 1942, visited the Pridmore's club in 1948 and assigned two of his "ikkyū ("first "<a href="ky%C5%AB">kyū</a>" / brown belt) students to assist them (it is unclear if Mitani had been teaching judo during the six years since he had arrived in Winnipeg, but the fact he had students suggests that he was). Glen Pridmore left Winnipeg in 1949, and by 1950 Mitani had taken over the YMCA club and established branches with the help of Ron Fulton, Jack Kelly, and Jimmy Iwabuchi at Carpiquet Barracks, the <a href="CFB%20Winnipeg">RCAF base</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">RCMP</a> barracks on Portage Avenue. The branches lasted about a year, and in 1951 Mitani moved the YMCA club to the RCMP barracks. Bob Demby started another, short-lived judo club at the YMCA, which was followed by a self-defence class organised by Ron Fulton that slowly became a judo club over the years. In 1952, Mitani established The Manitoba Judo Institute, with the help of Harold Shimane and Noboru Shimizu, on the seventh floor of the McIntyre Block on Main Street. There was a club at the RCAF base again as early as 1956, organized by <a href="Flying%20officer">Flying Officer</a> Vinsel and <a href="Leading%20aircraftman">Leading Aircraftman</a> Delasalle, and supported by Mitani (it may have operated sporadically or had different incarnations, as a 1960 article reports that it was founded by <a href="Masao%20Takahashi">Masao Takahashi</a> in 1958). The first club outside of Winnipeg was established at the <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon</a> YMCA in 1953 by Harold Starn, a former British <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> soldier who received his judo training from Japanese prisoners he guarded in <a href="Myanmar">Burma</a> during the war.

Morton J. Tenzer

Morton J. Tenzer (1931– ) is an American political scientist specializing <a href="public%20administration">public administration</a>. He is the founder of the Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program at the <a href="University%20of%20Connecticut">University of Connecticut</a> and was its director from 1973 to 1986. Tenzer was a member of the university's Political Science Department from 1968 to 1993.

Section::::Early years.
Tenzer grew up in his native New York City until age 12, when his family moved to <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, where he graduated from <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Connecticut%29">Central High School</a> in 1949. Bridgeport was a booming industrial town during World War II; observing its social and economic life and comparing it to that of New York may have been the source of his lifelong interest in the workings of cities.

During his childhood and in later years, Tenzer enjoyed fellowship with an extended clan of relatives through the Tenzer Family Circle, established by his grandfather’s brother Michael Tenzer. Several Tenzer brothers had immigrated to the US at the start of the 20th century from near <a href="Tarn%C3%B3w">Tarnów</a> in southern Poland (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

Tenzer attended college at the University of Connecticut, initially at the Avery Point branch and then at the main Storrs campus, graduating in 1953. That year he married Virginia Copes of Watertown, Connecticut, also a UConn graduate.

Section::::Career.
Following graduate study at Yale, Tenzer took up a position teaching political science and government at <a href="Wesleyan%20University">Wesleyan University</a> (1956–62), followed by a year at <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a>. He then spent a year working for the <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20Service%20Commission">United States Civil Service Commission</a> (a federal agency) in New York City, where he learned much about government administration. 

From 1965 to 1968, Tenzer worked at the Institute of Public Administration, a policy think-tank in New York providing consultation to governments in the US and around the world. In 1966 he was involved in helping the incoming administration of New York Mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> to consolidate some twenty-five city human welfare agencies down to ten. He also worked on a project sponsored by Vice President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> about states’ handling of shoreline management. His international projects were based in Brazil, Egypt, and Peru, and included travel to the first two countries. Because of his experience advising on real issues of governmental organization and policy, he was recruited by two of his former professors to return to UConn to teach political science.

At UConn, Tenzer joined the Political Science Department and was affiliated with the Institute of Urban Research and the Center for Oral History. His main focus, however, was a drive to establish an MPA program. In 1973 it came into being with Tenzer as its director. Under his leadership the MPA program grew to include 6 full-time faculty. Among its graduates is <a href="John%20DeStefano%20Jr.">John DeStefano Jr.</a>, mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, from 1994 to 2014.

In addition to academic activities, Tenzer continued his consulting work and traveled overseas, helping to assess and shape policy for USAID in the Philippines; for USIS in Sri Lanka; and for local governments in the former Soviet Union, through a project of the <a href="International%20Institute%20of%20Administrative%20Sciences">International Institute of Administrative Sciences</a> (Brussels).

Section::::Development and design.
The "Sverdlov"-class cruisers, Soviet designation Project 68bis, were the last conventional gun <a href="Cruiser">cruisers</a> built for the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a>. They were built in the 1950s and were based on Soviet, German, and Italian designs and concepts developed prior to the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. They were modified to improve their sea keeping capabilities, allowing them to run at high speed in the rough waters of the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>. The basic hull was more modern and had better armor protection than the vast majority of the post Second World War gun cruiser designs built and deployed by peer nations. They also carried an extensive suite of modern <a href="radar">radar</a> equipment and <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft artillery</a>. The Soviets originally planned to build 40 ships in the class, which would be supported by the s and <a href="Aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carriers</a>.

The "Sverdlov" class <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> 13,600 tons standard and 16,640 tons at full load. They were  <a href="Length%20overall">long overall</a> and  long at the waterline. They had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of  and <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of  and typically had a complement of 1,250. The hull was a completely welded new design and the ships had a double bottom for over 75% of their length. The ship also had twenty-three <a href="Watertight%20bulkhead">watertight bulkheads</a>. The "Sverdlov"s had six boilers providing steam to two shaft <a href="Gear">geared</a> <a href="Steam%20turbine">steam turbines</a> generating . This gave the ships a maximum speed of . The cruisers had a range of  at .

"Sverdlov"-class cruisers main armament included twelve /57 cal B-38 guns mounted in four triple Mk5-bis turrets. They also had twelve /56 cal Model 1934 guns in six twin SM-5-1 mounts. For anti-aircraft weaponry, the cruisers had thirty-two  anti-aircraft guns in sixteen twin mounts and were also equipped with ten  <a href="Torpedo%20tube">torpedo tubes</a> in two mountings of five each.

The "Sverdlov"s had   <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> and had a   armored <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a>. The <a href="Gun%20turret">turrets</a> were shielded by  armor and the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>, by  armor.

The cruisers' ultimate radar suite included one 'Big Net' or 'Top Trough' air search radar, one 'High Sieve' or 'Low Sieve' air search radar, one 'Knife Rest' air search radar and one 'Slim Net' air search radar. For navigational radar they had one 'Don-2' or 'Neptune' model. For fire control purposes the ships were equipped with two 'Sun Visor' radars, two 'Top Bow' 152 mm gun radars and eight 'Egg Cup' gun radars. For electronic countermeasures the ships were equipped with two 'Watch Dog' ECM systems.
Section::::Construction and career.
The ship was built at <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyards">Admiralty Shipyard</a> in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> and was <a href="Launched%20%28ship%29">launched</a> on 29 June 1951 and <a href="Commissioned%20%28ship%29">commissioned</a> on 27 March 1953.

On 8 February 1953, she became a member of the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Red Banner Black Sea Fleet</a>.

In 1955, she was reequipped according to the Project 67EP with the installation of the Quiver missile system (including a single KSS launch missile). It was used for experimental purposes for testing KSS anti-ship missiles at the <a href="Feodosia">Feodosiya</a> test site, launching first at conventional <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>s, and later at the compartment of the unfinished cruiser Stalingrad of Project 82. The Quiver complex was successfully tested, but was not adopted for service in the strength of its weakness for the designed cruisers of Project 67, the refusal of the USSR to build large surface ships, as well as the obsolescence of the KSS anti-ship missiles.

On 28 July 1960, she was disarmed and expelled from the Navy in connection with the transfer to the OFI for dismantling and sale.

In June 1961, she was shot by <a href="KSShch">KSShch</a> anti-ship missiles by the <a href="Soviet%20destroyer%20Prozorliviy">Prozorliviy destroyer</a>. She was not repaired and in 1961-62, she was cut into metal on the basis of Glavvtorchermet in <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>.

Part of the cruiser equipment, transferred to the Sevastopol Instrument-Making Institute (currently <a href="Sevastopol%20State%20University">Sevastopol State University</a>) in 1964, in particular, the auxiliary steam boiler KVS-68, is still used in the educational process on the technical territory of the Department of Marine Technology and Shipping (Sevastopol, Gogol street, 14, room 136).

Samuel Austin (soldier)

Samuel Austin (8 June 1831 – 25 January 1903) was an Irishman who served with the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and the New Zealand colonial militia. He was a recipient of one of the world’s rarest gallantry decorations, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Cross%20%281869%29">New Zealand Cross</a>.

Born in <a href="County%20Armagh">County Armagh</a>, Austin joined the British Army in 1844 and was posted to the 65th Regiment of Foot. He served in Ireland, Australia and in New Zealand, where he fought in the <a href="Hutt%20Valley%20campaign">Hutt Valley campaign</a>. He lived in <a href="Whanganui">Whanganui</a> after his discharge, taking up labouring work to support his family. He was called up for service in militia during the <a href="Second%20Taranaki%20War">Second Taranaki War</a> and was posted to the Whanganui Native Contingent (WNC) as the unit's <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>. He was involved in several engagements during the conflict and on two instances rescued wounded officers while under fire. He was later awarded the New Zealand Cross for these actions. He was part of the WNC's involvement in the pursuits of <a href="T%C4%ABtokowaru">Tītokowaru</a> and <a href="Te%20Kooti">Te Kooti</a>. Returning to civilian life in 1870, he worked as a labourer. He died in January 1903. 

Section::::Early life.
Born on 8 June 1831 at <a href="Tandragee">Tandragee</a>, in <a href="County%20Armagh">County Armagh</a>, Northern Ireland, Samuel Austin was the younger of two boys born to James Austin, a <a href="Weaving">weaver</a>, and his wife Hannah . In August 1844, having received some basic schooling, he was working as a weaver when he decided to join the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. 

Section::::Service with the British Army.
Claiming to be 15 years of age, Austin was posted as a private to the <a href="65th%20%282nd%20Yorkshire%2C%20North%20Riding%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">65th Regiment of Foot</a>, then serving at <a href="Mullingar">Mullingar</a>, in the <a href="Midlands%20Region%2C%20Ireland">Midlands</a> of Ireland. At the time, the regiment was helping to control increasing unrest in the Midlands. It shortly moved to <a href="Castlebar">Castlebar</a>, fulfilling a similar function. During this time Austin became ill and had to be hospitalised for several weeks. In 1845, Austin's company was sent to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>, where it was to guard convicts on prison ships destined for Australia. At the end of the year, he was part of a detachment of the 65th Regiment that provided guards for the "China", which carried 200 convicts to <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>. After transporting the convicts to their destination, the "China" and Austin's detachment went onto <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, arriving in June 1846.

Section::::New Zealand.
The following month, Austin's detachment was sent to New Zealand, in response to a request from its <a href="Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand">governor</a>, <a href="George%20Grey">Sir George Grey</a>, for British troops to assist in putting down unrest in the country. In early August, he was involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Battle%20Hill">Battle of Battle Hill</a>, an attack on a "<a href="p%C4%81">pā</a>" (fortress) of <a href="Te%20Rangihaeata">Te Rangihaeata</a>, a Māori war chief, during the <a href="Hutt%20Valley%20campaign">Hutt Valley campaign</a>. He was then part of a detachment engaged in patrolling duties in the bush area around <a href="P%C4%81uatahanui">Pāuatahanui</a> before joining a garrison at a <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a> in <a href="Paremata">Paremata</a>. For several months, he was engaged in road construction for several months before being sent to <a href="Whanganui">Whanganui</a> in June 1847 along with 150 other soldiers of the 65th Regiment. He fought in the <a href="Whanganui%20campaign">Whanganui campaign</a> against the forces of <a href="Te%20Mamaku">Te Mamaku</a>. 

On 30 May 1851, Austin married Lavinia née Newport, the daughter of an English settler and his wife, at the mission church in <a href="Putiki">Putiki</a>. In August 1854, he was posted to <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, to serve in the headquarters of the 65th Regiment. The following year he was promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. After a period of service in <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a> as a medical orderly, in July 1859, he was discharged from the British Army with the rank of <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>, having completed his period of service.

Returning to Whanganui, Austin took up labouring work to supplement the financial grant that he received upon his discharge. He was also due a land grant for his military service. In May 1860, he joined the local militia, the Whanganui Volunteers, serving as an officer and then as the drill instructor for the Whanganui District. His land grant was allocated at the end of the following year, and this was an allotment of 84 acres to the northeast of Whanganui. He took up farming, running cattle and poultry. This, along with his growing family for he had three children by 1863, impacted the amount of time he was able to spend on militia duties.

Section::::Service with the Whanganui Native Contingent.
For much of 1864 and 1865, the area around Whanganui and the <a href="Taranaki">Taranaki</a> experienced increasing tensions due to the growth of the <a href="Hauhau%20movement">Hauhau movement</a>. There was increasing violence between followers of the Hauhau and British troops and colonists and thus lead to the <a href="Second%20Taranaki%20War">Second Taranaki War</a>. When a neighbour was murdered by the Hauhau, Austin moved his family into Whanganui and was called up for the militia. Much to his frustration, his stock was confiscated for food for the militia. He was deployed to <a href="Parikino">Parikino</a>, on attachment to the <a href="57th%20%28West%20Middlesex%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">57th Regiment of Foot</a> from March to June 1865 as its pay clerk. He then returned to Whanganui and was posted to the Whanganui Native Contingent (WNC), a unit of around 100 Māori "<a href="k%C5%ABpapa">kūpapa</a>" (Māori allied to the New Zealand Government), under the command of <a href="Te%20Keepa%20Te%20Rangihiwinui">Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui</a>. One of the few "<a href="p%C4%81keha">pākeha</a>s" (European New Zealanders) in the WNC, he served as its <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>, controlling supplies for the unit, and also drilled its soldiers. He was involved in an attack on Weraroa "pā", held by the Hauhau, on 21 July, leading a party of WNC although it was largely empty by the time they arrived. 

Around 300 men of the WNC, including Austin, were involved in <a href="Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="Trevor%20Chute">Trevor Chute</a>'s <a href="Second%20Taranaki%20War">campaign</a> against the Taranaki tribes and on 30 December, along with other colonial units and elements of the <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">14th</a>, <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20%281684%E2%80%931922%29">18th</a> and <a href="50th%20%28Queen%27s%20Own%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">50th Regiment</a>s, departed from Whanganui on an expedition into Southern Taranaki. On 4 January 1866, the British forces captured Okotuku "pā" and then three days sought to capture Pūtahi "pā". During this action, the commander of the WNC, <a href="Major%20%28rank%29">Major</a> <a href="Thomas%20McDonnell">Thomas McDonnell</a>, was wounded. Despite being under heavy fire, Austin rescued McDonnell and moved him to cover. Later in the year, he performed a similar action at Keteonetea, rescuing another wounded soldier; this happened to be Captain William McDonnell, the brother of Major McDonnell.

The WNC was later involved in a followup campaign in the Taranaki from August to November, led by McDonnell, and the hunt for <a href="Kereopa%20Te%20Rau">Kereopa Te Rau</a>, who had murdered the missionary <a href="Carl%20Sylvius%20V%C3%B6lkner">Carl Völkner</a> at <a href="%C5%8Cp%C5%8Dtiki">Ōpōtiki</a> in March 1865 and who was hiding in the <a href="Te%20Urewera">Urewera ranges</a>. From June 1868, they were part of <a href="T%C4%ABtokowaru%27s%20War">further campaigning</a> in the Taranaki, this time against <a href="T%C4%ABtokowaru">Tītokowaru</a>, a prophet agitating against colonial forces in the area and the following year was dispatched to the <a href="Gisborne%20District">East Coast</a> in pursuit of <a href="Te%20Kooti">Te Kooti</a>, another prophet who had attacked settlers in the <a href="Poverty%20Bay">Poverty Bay</a> region. Their last major engagement was at Te Porere, where Te Kooti was defeated but escaped. While the WNC returned to Whanganui while Austin briefly was in charge of stores in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> before going to Wellington to await clearance to pay the WNC their outstanding wages. During this time his wife died in child birth. He went to Whanganui to see to the funeral before going back to Wellington, leaving his teenage daughter in charge of the family. The funds for wages were eventually released and after organising its distribution to the soldiers of the WNC, he ended his military career.

Section::::Later life.
Returning to civilian life, Austin performed labouring work in Whanganui but struggled for money and had to mortgage his house in October 1872. The same year he was involved in a dispute with the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Defence Department</a> in relation to not being awarded the <a href="New%20Zealand%20War%20Medal">New Zealand War Medal</a> for his time in the militia. The medal was originally limited to military personnel of the British Army and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> who had served in New Zealand but in 1869, eligibility was extended to the colonial militia. Although Austin had received the medal in relation to his service with the 65th Regiment, he believed he was entitled to a second medal for the period of time he was with the WNC. The Defence Department did not agree with him and declined to issue another medal, which remained a sore point with Austin for the rest of his life.

Section::::New Zealand Cross.
The following year, Austin was nominated by Keepa for an award of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Cross%20%281869%29">New Zealand Cross</a> (NZC) for his service during the campaign in the Taranaki and the fighting against Te Kooti. The NZC was instituted in 1869 to recognised acts of gallantry performed by the country's colonial military forces and four years later, nominations were invited for scrutiny by a commission. Keepa's efforts to have Austin receive the NZC were supplemented by Major McDonnell, who wrote to the Secretary of Defence explaining the events that occurred at Keteonetea. Chute, who had witnessed Austin's actions at Pūtahi pā where he had rescued McDonnell under fire, also wrote in support. On 15 May 1876, the award was approved by <a href="George%20Phipps%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Normanby">George Phipps</a>, the Governor of New Zealand. The citation for Austin's NZC, published in the "<a href="New%20Zealand%20Gazette">New Zealand Gazette</a>", read:
Austin was presented with the NZC in March 1876 in a ceremony at Wanganui, with Keepa and <a href="Thomas%20Adamson%20%28soldier%29">Thomas Adamson</a> also being awarded the medal at the same time. Only 23 awards of the NZC were made, all for actions that took place during the New Zealand Wars, making it one of the rarest gallantry awards in the world.

Section::::Final years.
The award of the NZC entitled Austin to a small annual pension of £10. In late 1876, he began to receive a daily allowance as an <a href="Chelsea%20Pensioner">out-pensioner</a>, qualifying as a result of his service with the 65th Regiment, from the <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20Chelsea">Royal Hospital</a> at <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>; this amounted to £6 a year. By this time he was a farm worker. Socially, he was involved in the <a href="Orange%20Order">Orange Order</a>, rising to <a href="Masonic%20lodge%20officer">Worshipful Master</a> in the Whanganui Lodge by 1876, and helping establish a second Lodge the next year.

In February 1879, Austin married 26-year-old Alice Arnold, a servant from <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> who had emigrated to Whanganui the previous year. The couple would have four children. Life became easier for Austin, who was no longer labouring but instead was selling vegetables grown on land surrounding his property while his wife worked as a midwife. His health was in serious decline by 1895, and the same year he transferred ownership of his land to his wife. Austin died on 25 January 1903 at his home. He was given a military funeral and buried in the town's Old Cemetery, survived by his wife and the eight children of his two marriages.

Mount Tommy Thompson

Mount Tommy Thompson is a 6,780-foot-elevation (2,067 meter) mountain summit located in <a href="Skagit%20County%2C%20Washington">Skagit County</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> state. It is situated eight miles southeast of the town of <a href="Marblemount%2C%20Washington">Marblemount</a>, within the <a href="Glacier%20Peak%20Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>, on land managed by <a href="Mount%20Baker%E2%80%93Snoqualmie%20National%20Forest">Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest</a>, on the west slopes of the <a href="North%20Cascades">North Cascades</a> Range. The nearest higher named neighbor is <a href="Snowking%20Mountain">Snowking Mountain</a>, to the southeast. <a href="Topographic%20relief">Topographic relief</a> is significant as the southwest aspect rises 3,670 feet (1,118 meters) above Slide Lake in less than two miles. Precipitation <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a> from Mount Tommy Thompson drains into tributaries of the <a href="Skagit%20River">Skagit River</a>.

Section::::Etymology.
The mountain is unofficially named in honor of forest ranger Tommy Thompson (1884–1969). Born in England, his family immigrated to the United States in 1885. Tommy worked for the Forest Service from 1904 to 1943 in the Skagit district of the North Cascades. He made the first ascent of <a href="Ruby%20Mountain%20%28Washington%29">Ruby Mountain</a> in 1916.

Section::::Climate.
Mount Tommy Thompson is located in the <a href="marine%20west%20coast">marine west coast</a> climate zone of western <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Most <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a>s originate in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, and travel northeast toward the <a href="Cascade%20Mountains">Cascade Mountains</a>. As fronts approach the <a href="North%20Cascades">North Cascades</a>, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (<a href="Orographic%20lift">Orographic lift</a>), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime influence</a>, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high <a href="avalanche">avalanche</a> danger.

Section::::Geology.
The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> with craggy peaks and ridges, deep <a href="glacial%20valley">glacial valley</a>s, and <a href="granite">granite</a> spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.

The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> Epoch. With the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> overriding the <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific Plate</a>, episodes of <a href="volcano">volcanic igneous activity</a> persisted. In addition, small fragments of the <a href="oceanic%20lithosphere">oceanic</a> and <a href="continental%20lithosphere">continental lithosphere</a> called <a href="terrane">terrane</a>s created the <a href="North%20Cascades">North Cascades</a> about 50 million years ago.

During the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. <a href="orogeny">Uplift</a> and <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>ing in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Lego Fusion

Lego Fusion was a <a href="List%20of%20Lego%20themes">Lego theme</a> that combined standard Lego bricks with a mobile <a href="application%20software">app</a> that was designed to interact and communicate with the build models. The theme was first introduced in 2014 and exclusively in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The theme was considered to be a development or upgrade from the 2011 Lego Life of George theme. It was eventually discontinued by the end of 2015.

Each Lego Fusion experience consists of a distinct set of Lego bricks, a corresponding free downloadable app and the new Lego Fusion capture plate, a small brick building plate with a printed design that enables a smart phone or tablet's camera to identify the size and colors of the Lego bricks built onto it. In response to game prompts, children build vertically in 2-D on the Fusion capture plate, enabling the app to 'see,' import and transform the creation into 3-D in the digital world. Lego Future Lab senior design manager Ditte Bruun Pedersen explained, "In our research, we heard repeatedly from parents that they are constantly battling 'zombie gaze,' the experience when their children are immersed in their device screens for large blocks of time," and continued, "We developed Lego Fusion with this challenge in mind, creating a play experience that keeps children entertained with the kind of app gameplay they love while giving real reasons to return to the brick pile to creatively build."

Death of Amber Tuccaro

Amber Alyssa Tuccaro (3 January 1990 – disappeared 18 August 2010) was a <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> woman from <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> who went missing in 2010. Tuccaro was last seen near <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, hitchhiking with an unidentified man. Her remains were found in 2012. , her case is still unsolved.

The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> investigation of her disappearance was sharply criticized by the Tuccaro family, who alleged that police downplayed their concerns. A federal review released in 2018 found that the RCMP's investigation was "deficient" and "did not comply with procedures and guidelines".

Her case is among the high number of <a href="missing%20and%20murdered%20Indigenous%20women">missing and murdered Indigenous women</a> of Canada.

Section::::Background.
Amber Tuccaro was born in 1990 in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. She was a member of the <a href="Mikisew%20Cree%20First%20Nation">Mikisew Cree First Nation</a>. At the time of her disappearance, she was living in <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a>, Alberta with her mother and 14-month-old son.

Section::::Disappearance.
In August 2010, Tuccaro flew from her home in Fort McMurray to <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> with her infant son and a female friend for a short vacation. The group booked into a hotel in nearby <a href="Nisku">Nisku</a>.

Tuccaro was last seen the following day, 18 August at about 8 pm, when she accepted a ride into Edmonton from an unknown man. She received a phone call during the ride in which the male driver can be heard in the background assuring Tuccaro that they are heading east on a back road toward Edmonton. Police believe the man actually drove south into rural <a href="Leduc%20County">Leduc County</a>. 

Police released a recording of the phone call in 2012. Tuccaro can be heard in the recording telling the driver, "You'd better not be taking me anywhere I don’t want to go." Investigators continue to seek the assistance of the public to identify the voice of the driver.

Tuccaro's remains were discovered by horseback riders on 1 September 2012 in a field in Leduc County. Her remains were positively identified by dental records.

Section::::Investigation.
The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) did not immediately list Tuccaro as a missing person, explaining to family members that she might be out partying and that they would need to wait 24 hours. She was eventually listed as a missing person, but was removed from the list based on unconfirmed sightings. On 4 September 2010, the RCMP publicly stated that they did not believe Tuccaro was in danger.

The RCMP waited until one month after Tuccaro's disappearance to begin its investigation. The police service waited four months to begin conducting interviews. Tuccaro's travel companion – the last person known to have seen her alive – was never considered a person of interest by the RCMP, and she was never located or interviewed.

In 2014, Tuccaro's family filed a complaint with the <a href="Civilian%20Review%20and%20Complaints%20Commission%20for%20the%20Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>. The RCMP issued a report in 2018 which concluded that its investigation was "deficient in that various members were either not properly trained or did not adhere to their training and that various members did not comply with procedures and guidelines." Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki apologized to the family, stating that the investigation "was not our best work." The family rejected Zablocki's apology.

Louise Wüste

Louise Wüste or Wueste, née Heuser (6 June 1805, <a href="Gummersbach">Gummersbach</a> - 25 September 1874, <a href="Eagle%20Pass%2C%20Texas">Eagle Pass, Texas</a>) was a German-American portrait artist; associated with the <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorfer%20Malerschule">Düsseldorfer Malerschule</a>.

Section::::Life and work.
She was the first of six children born to the paint and wine merchant, Heinrich Daniel Theodor Heuser (1767–1848), and his wife, Katharina Luisa née Jügel (1776–1841). Her grandfather, , was the founder of a large trading company. Her aunt, <a href="Henriette%20J%C3%BCgel">Henriette Jügel</a>, taught her how to paint and draw, and her mother taught her how to play the harp. Her sisters, <a href="Adeline%20Jaeger">Adeline</a> and <a href="Alwine%20Schroedter">Alwine</a> also became painters. Another sister, Ida (1817-1880), married the painter <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Lessing">Karl Friedrich Lessing</a> in 1841. 

In 1824, she married Dr. Peter Wilhelm Leopold Wüste (1795–1832), a frequent guest for musical evenings at the Heuser household. They had two daughters and a son. After Peter's death, she and her children went to live with her parents. There, she established a small painting school for girls. In 1848, after her father's death, she went to live with her daughter, Adeline (1828-1912), who had married an estate manager, Heino Staffel (1818–1904). It was then she decided to take formal art lessons. She therefore went to <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, where she studied privately with <a href="Friedrich%20Boser">Friedrich Boser</a>, <a href="Karl%20Ferdinand%20Sohn">Karl Ferdinand Sohn</a>, and her brother-in-law, Lessing. 

Adeline and her family emigrated to the United States in 1851; settling in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>. Through the remainder of the 1850s, she lived in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. Then, in 1859, her other daughter, Emma, also emigrated to the United States; settling in <a href="Pleasanton%2C%20Texas">Pleasanton</a>, near San Antonio. She soon followed, and went to live with Adeline again. There, she opened a portrait studio. She also devoted herself to sketching Texan and <a href="Mexican-American">Mexican-American</a> scenes. 

The outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> severely reduced her income, but she was able to buy a small house in Eagle Pass, not far from her son, Daniel (1830-1882), who had also emigrated and become a merchant. Her later sketches focus on the people and places along the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>. Most of her works are in private collections, or still in the possession of their subjects' families.

La Ruche (school)

La Ruche ("The Hive") was a French school founded by <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Faure">Sébastien Faure</a> on anarchist principles.

Section::::History.
The anarchist <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Faure">Sébastien Faure</a> founded "La Ruche" on 20 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s of leased farmland in <a href="Le%20P%C3%A2tis">Le Pâtis</a>, near <a href="Rambouillet">Rambouillet</a>, on the outskirts of Paris in 1904. The land was both the grounds for his alternative, experimental school and an anarchist commune. The school's name, "La Ruche", or "The Hive", comes from the land's resource of honey, which the school used as supplementary income. Faure also funded the school through his lectures and books. He established a cooperative to buy and market the farm's produce. "La Ruche" operated as a <a href="soviet%20%28council%29">soviet</a>, following the will of the staff's weekly general assembly. The colony persisted through the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when it closed under Faure's financial deficits.

Section::::Program.
The school followed a program modeled on that of anarchist pedagogue <a href="Paul%20Robin">Paul Robin</a>. About 50 children between the ages of 5 and 16 attended the school, selected from an applicant pool. Children of politically repressed families were given special consideration, such as those of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Henry%20%28anarchist%29">Émile Henry</a>. Ideologically, Faure did not impose his anarchist beliefs on the children, but afforded the children full autonomy—they were not coerced into a specific course of study. "La Ruche" offered Esperanto lessons through the age of 10, when children were put into pre-apprenticeships that rotated between workshops multiple times per month. They began formal apprenticeships with a wage at the age of 13, whereupon they produced goods for the school. "La Ruche" used Paul Robin's approach to sex education and mixed-gender classes.

Teachers were unpaid. A common fund provided for their needs and lodging. There were no checks on the disbursement of the fund and there are no records of the arrangement being an issue.

Section::::Legacy.
Following "La Ruche" closure, Faure's disciple <a href="Aristide%20Lapeyre">Aristide Lapeyre</a> established the Elan school of <a href="Villeneuve-sur-Lot">Villeneuve-sur-Lot</a>, which persisted from the 1930s through <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Kevin Strickland

Kevin Strickland (born June 7, 1959) is an African-American man who was convicted by an <a href="all-white%20jury">all-white jury</a> in 1979 of killing three people in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, in a case where no <a href="physical%20evidence">physical evidence</a> linked him to the scene of the crime. Strickland was imprisoned and is serving a <a href="life%20sentence">life sentence</a>. In 2021, he garnered national attention after former prosecutors in his case said he was innocent and called for his release.

Two men who pled guilty to the murders have said Strickland was not involved, and a <a href="fingerprint">fingerprint</a> from the <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> used in the murders belonged to someone else. Cynthia Douglas, the sole eyewitness to the crime, said detectives pressured her into naming Strickland as a perpetrator. She attempted several times to recant her testimony before her death in 2015.

Numerous legal and political figures have called for Strickland's <a href="exoneration">exoneration</a>. In June 2021, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Missouri">Supreme Court of Missouri</a> denied a <a href="petition">petition</a> to have him released. The <a href="Governor%20of%20Missouri">Governor of Missouri</a> <a href="Mike%20Parson">Mike Parson</a> refused to <a href="pardon">pardon</a> him, saying he did not see his case as a "priority" and was not certain of his innocence. The office of the <a href="Missouri%20Attorney%20General">Missouri Attorney General</a> has fought in court to keep him in prison, saying it believes him to be guilty.

Section::::Crime and trials.
On April 25, 1978, in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, three people were killed when a group of assailants ransacked a house. The victims were 22-year-old Sherrie Black, 21-year-old Larry Ingram, and 20-year-old John Walker. Another woman, Cynthia Douglas, Ingram's girlfriend, was shot in the leg non-fatally; she <a href="apparent%20death">pretended to be dead</a> until the attackers left, at which point she crawled out of the house. All of the victims were tied up and then shot. Strickland, who was then 18 years old, said at the time he was watching <a href="television">television</a> and talking on the phone, and that the next morning police began accusing him of the murders.

Two suspects, Kilm Adkins and Vincent Bell, were later arrested. Bell was a childhood friend of Strickland's, and lived at a house nearby. Police found a fingerprint belonging to Strickland on Bell's car; Strickland says this was because he had driven the car before, but the last time he had seen Adkins and Bell was at 5 or 6 p.m. on the night of the murders. A fingerprint from the <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> used in the murders belonged to someone other than Strickland who has not yet been identified. Douglas, the only eyewitness, later picked out Strickland in a <a href="police%20lineup">police lineup</a>. Douglas later said she was pressured into naming him as one of the perpetrators by detectives on the case, and until her death in 2015 attempted to have her testimony recanted. In 2009, she emailed the <a href="Midwest%20Innocence%20Project">Midwest Innocence Project</a>, saying, "I am seeking info on how to help someone that was wrongfully accused. I was the only eyewitness and things were not clear back then, but now I know more and would like to help this person if I can." Douglas said police told her, "Just pick Strickland out of the lineup and we'll be done, it will all go away, you can go on and you don’t have to worry about these guys no more." Adkins and Bell confessed to the murders, but said Strickland was not a participant.

Strickland's first trial ended in a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a>, with the only black juror refusing to find him guilty. According to Strickland, after the trial, the prosecutor approached his lawyer and said "I'll make sure this doesn't happen next time." Strickland's current lawyer, Tricia Rojo Bushnell of the Midwest Innocence Project, said the prosecutor used each of his <a href="peremptory%20challenge">peremptory challenge</a>s to strike black jurors, resulting in the next trial having an <a href="all-white%20jury">all-white jury</a>.

Strickland was convicted in 1979, one year after being arrested, and sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> without the chance of <a href="parole">parole</a> for 50 years. Adkins and Bell later cut <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>s, serving 10 years each. A third suspect was not charged.

Section::::Calls for release.
Strickland was the subject of an investigation by "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>" in September 2020, which prompted prosecutors to review the case. On May 10, 2021, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Missouri">Jackson County</a> prosecutor Jean Peters Baker published a letter saying she believed he was innocent and should be released from prison. Former prosecutors in Strickland's case have said they think he is innocent as well, as have federal prosecutors for the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Missouri">United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri</a>. <a href="Mayor%20of%20Kansas%20City">Mayor of Kansas City</a> <a href="Quinton%20Lucas">Quinton Lucas</a> and more than a dozen state lawmakers, including <a href="Andrew%20McDaniel">Andrew McDaniel</a>, the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> chair to the <a href="Missouri%20House%20of%20Representatives">Missouri House of Representatives</a>' committee overseeing prisons, have sought to have him released.

The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Missouri">Supreme Court of Missouri</a> denied a <a href="petition">petition</a> to release Strickland in June 2021. In August 2021, <a href="Governor%20of%20Missouri">Governor of Missouri</a> <a href="Mike%20Parson">Mike Parson</a> refused to <a href="pardon">pardon</a> him, having previously said that Strickland's case was not a "priority" and that he was not sure of Strickland's innocence. The <a href="editorial%20board">editorial board</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", as well as some prominent <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> figures, negatively contrasted Parson's decision not to pardon Strickland with his choice to pardon Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple involved in the June 2020 <a href="St.%20Louis%20gun-toting%20controversy">St. Louis gun-toting controversy</a>. Assistant attorney general of Missouri Andrew Clarke said the attorney general's office believes Strickland to be guilty and thinks he should remain in prison, saying that Strickland had "worked to evade responsibility." In August 2021, the attorney general's office issued Baker a <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a> requiring her to turn over any communication with third parties regarding Strickland; Baker called this <a href="harassment">harassment</a>.

<doc id="68480761" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68480761" title="The Curse of the Mekons">
The Curse of the Mekons

The Curse of the Mekons is the ninth studio album by English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20Mekons">The Mekons</a>, released in 1991. Due to a disagreement with <a href="A%26amp%3BM%20Records">A&M Records</a>, the album was not released in the U.S. until a decade later, being available only as an import from their British label <a href="Blast%20First">Blast First</a>. It has been hailed by critics as one of the best of the Mekons' career. 

It includes a cover of <a href="John%20Scott%20Sherrill">John Scott Sherrill</a>'s "Wild and Blue".

Section::::Background.
The "curse" of the title referred to the band's long-lasting lack of commercial success despite their increasingly lauded critical profile. <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> critic <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> wrote that the band "makes great, raucous, tuneful rock albums, but no one can figure out how to sell them." Founding member <a href="Tom%20Greenhalgh">Tom Greenhalgh</a> also said that the "curse" was meant ironically as a nod to the Mekons' survival as a band for a decade and a half, as if they had been doomed to "still being around (as a rock band) despite everything else".

"The Curse of the Mekons" was recorded during a period when the band was dispirited and unhappy about their comparative lack of success while alternative rock as a genre was reaching its highest popular acclaim. By this point, the band itself had also splintered geographically, with different members living in Chicago, Brooklyn, and England. The lettering on the album cover was written by leader <a href="Jon%20Langford">Jon Langford</a> using his own blood; it also included what writer <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> described as a "witch's anti-curse written in Nordic script, designed to reverse years of misfortune".

After years of increasing critical buzz, the Mekons had signed to major label A&M Records for their previous album, 1989's "<a href="The%20Mekons%20Rock%20%27n%20Roll">The Mekons Rock 'n Roll</a>". But despite earning widespread critical acclaim, the album sold poorly in America, reportedly around 23,000 copies. The band's relationship with the label became fractured, with the Mekons unhappy that A&M had failed to capitalize on the band's critical success. The group released a four-song EP on A&M, "F.U.N. '90", before recording "The Curse of the Mekons". The label's acquisition by <a href="Polygram">Polygram</a> left the band without institutional support at A&M, which dropped the Mekons and shelved the album. It was not released in the U.S. until 2001.

After the recording of "The Curse of the Mekons", drummer <a href="Steve%20Goulding">Steve Goulding</a> and bassist <a href="Lu%20Edmonds">Lu Edmonds</a> both quit the band; they were replaced by, respectively, <a href="John%20Langley">John Langley</a> of the <a href="Blue%20Aeroplanes">Blue Aeroplanes</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Corina">Sarah Corina</a>.

Section::::Reception.
The album received positive reviews at the time of its release, and has continued to be a critical favorite over time. The album was named No. 10 of the top 10 albums of 1991 in the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>"s 1991 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics poll, the first import ever to make the list.

<a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, in his liner notes for the album's 2001 re-release, noted that the album captured the band's pessimism about a future dominated by capitalism after the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and apparent failure of socialism, saying that ""Curse of the Mekons" fleshes out their anarchist principles by abjuring power—it's messy, slightly inchoate, as unreconstructed and inconclusive as their nevertheless radical politics."

"The New York Times" Pareles called it "a brilliant album that wraps tuneful rockers around topics like German reunification, the drug business and the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe", and wrote that the band had moved past their earlier, deliberate amateurism, saying that their songs of this era were "loose and rangy" and "have a muscular beat and catchy guitar riffs, yet they never sound too polished."

<a href="Mike%20Boehm">Mike Boehm</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote that in comparison to the hard-driving sound of their previous album, "Curse" "eases back on the throttle a bit, giving more emphasis to the country-music roots that have marked the band’s work since the mid-'80s," but also noted that the lyrics were just as biting as earlier: "The songs are full of images of a culture out of whack, numbed by drugs and the desire for consumer commodities, subject to authoritarian control and ravaged by violence."

John Dougan of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called "The Curse of the Mekons" the second-best Mekons album after 1989's "<a href="The%20Mekons%20Rock%20%27n%20Roll">The Mekons Rock 'n Roll</a>", writing that the album was "heady stuff, and not all happy, but remarkably assured and very rewarding." In the book "Rough Guide to Rock", critic Huw Bucknell called the album "subtle, atmospheric and criminally underexposed". "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press</a>" called the album "among the Mekons' most accomplished" and praised the album's eclectic sound, saying it created a "bizarre sonic odyssey" moving from the "Stonesy-Cajun hook of the title song" to metal, reggae with mariachi horns, and psychedelia. In 2014, Timothy and Elizabeth Bracy of music website "<a href="Stereogum">Stereogum</a>" called the album "brilliant roots rock with an authoritative swagger" and listed two songs from the album, "The Curse" and "Waltz", among their top 10 Mekons songs of all time.

Fall of Kabul (2021)

<a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> forces took control of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>'s capital city of <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> on 15 August 2021 during <a href="2021%20Taliban%20offensive">a military offensive</a> against the <a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghan government</a> that had begun in May 2021. The capture took place hours after <a href="President%20of%20Afghanistan">President</a> <a href="Ashraf%20Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a> fled the country. Most of the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Afghanistan">provincial</a> capitals of Afghanistan had fallen in succession in the midst of a <a href="Withdrawal%20of%20United%20States%20troops%20from%20Afghanistan%20%282020%E2%80%932021%29">US troop withdrawal</a> under a <a href="Doha%20Agreement%20%282020%29">February 2020 US–Taliban agreement</a> that concluded on 30 August 2021.

<a href="US%20intelligence">US intelligence</a> assessments estimated as late as July that Kabul would fall within months or weeks following withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, though the security situation deteriorated rapidly, leading US President <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> to concede on 16 August that "this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated."

Between 14 August and 31 August 2021 (when the US military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan), <a href="2021%20evacuation%20from%20Afghanistan">the US and its coalition partners evacuated more than 123,000 people</a> from Afghanistan via airlifts from the <a href="Hamid%20Karzai%20International%20Airport">Hamid Karzai International Airport</a> in Kabul; the US military and its <a href="NATO">NATO</a> partners provided security for the airport and airfield. Evacuees included foreign diplomatic staff and military personnel, foreign civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans such as journalists and human rights activists. The airlift was the largest non-combatant evacuation mission in US military history, with US military personnel taking 79,000 civilians through the airport and out of Afghanistan over the 18-day mission. Those evacuated included about 6,000 Americans.

Following the U.S. withdrawal, around one thousand U.S. citizens and Afghans holding U.S. or other visas were held stranded by the Taliban. Two weeks later, secretary of state <a href="Antony%20Blinken">Antony Blinken</a> said it was "several thousand" US residents and one hundred US citizens.

It was negotiated by <a href="Zalmay%20Khalilzad">Zalmay Khalilzad</a>.

The Agreement provided for the <a href="Withdrawal%20of%20United%20States%20troops%20from%20Afghanistan%20%282020%E2%80%932021%29">withdrawal of all NATO forces from Afghanistan</a> in return for a Taliban pledge to prevent <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> from operating in areas under Taliban control, as well as ongoing talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The United States agreed to an initial reduction of its force level from 13,000 to 8,600 within 135 days (ie., by July 2020), followed by a full withdrawal within 14 months (ie., by 1 May 2021) if the Taliban keeps its commitments.

In April 2021, the <a href="United%20States%20State%20Department">US State Department</a> urged American civilians in Afghanistan to "leave as soon as possible on available commercial flights".

The Taliban and allied militant groups began a widespread offensive on 1 May 2021, concurrent with the withdrawal of most <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">US troops</a> from Afghanistan. In July 2021, the <a href="United%20States%20Intelligence%20Community">US intelligence community</a> concluded that the government of Afghanistan could collapse between six to 12 months after the departure of American troops.

Following its rapid defeat across the country, the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a> was left in chaos, and only two units remained operational by mid-August: the <a href="201st%20Corps%20%28Afghanistan%29">201st Corps</a> and 111th Division, both based in Kabul. The capital city was left encircled after Taliban forces had captured <a href="Mihtarlam">Mihtarlam</a>, <a href="Sharana">Sharana</a>, <a href="Gardez">Gardez</a>, <a href="Asadabad%2C%20Afghanistan">Asadabad</a>, and other cities as well as districts in the east. In the days preceding the fall, projections for the security situation of Kabul rapidly worsened. An early August US intelligence assessment found that Kabul could hold out for several months, but by five days before the Taliban reached Kabul, intelligence suggested the capital would last "30 to 90 days", and within two days, intelligence suggested the city would fall within the week.

The day before the fall, Afghanistan Policy Lab director Timor Sharan told <a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe/Radio%20Liberty">Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a> that "shopping in the city today, I felt people were gripped by a sense of being stuck; stuck in an uncertain future and never able to dream, aspire, think, and believe anymore." 

Section::::Capture of Kabul.
Section::::Collapse of the Afghan government.
On 15 August 2021, the Taliban command instructed its forces to halt their advance at the gates of Kabul, declaring that they would not seize the city by force, though their forces entered its outskirts. Muhammad Nasir Haqqani, a Taliban commander, said that when he arrived at the city's gates, he didn't find a single soldier or policemen in sight.
Locals reported that Taliban fighters were advancing into the urban areas regardless of their leaders' official declarations. After some clashes, the insurgents captured the <a href="Pul-e-Charkhi%20prison">Pul-e-Charkhi prison</a> and released all inmates, reportedly including captured <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a> and Al-Qaeda militants. The Taliban also reported to have killed around 150 ISIL militants, including its former chief Abu Umar Khurasani, while the prisoners were being released from the jail. <a href="Bagram%20Airfield">Bagram Airfield</a> and the <a href="Parwan%20Detention%20Facility">Parwan Detention Facility</a>, which held 5,000 prisoners, also fell to the Taliban.

Taliban fighters faced little to no resistance from the Afghan government forces when they entered Kabul. Taliban fighters raised their flag in several areas of the city and pressured some police to hand over all their weaponry. At least 22 <a href="Afghan%20Air%20Force">Afghan Air Force</a> planes and 24 helicopters carrying 585 Afghan military personnel fled to <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. One Afghan <a href="Embraer%20EMB%20314%20Super%20Tucano">A-29 Super Tucano</a> crashed after crossing the border, with Uzbek authorities issuing conflicting reports on the cause. Two Afghan military planes carrying over 100 soldiers also landed in the <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> city of <a href="Bokhtar">Bokhtar</a>.

The Afghan Interior Ministry stated that President Ashraf Ghani had decided to relinquish power and an interim government led by the Taliban would be formed. Afterward, fighting died down, although many civilians remained fearful and holed up in their homes. By late morning on 15 August, Taliban negotiators had arrived at the presidential palace to begin a transfer of power. Although negotiations were tense, the government declared its willingness to peacefully surrender Kabul to the rebels, and they urged civilians to remain calm. <a href="Al%20Arabiya">Al Arabiya</a> reported that a transitional government would be formed under the leadership of former minister <a href="Ali%20Jalali">Ali Jalali</a>, but this was later denied by the Taliban.

Later that day, Ghani had left Afghanistan with Vice President <a href="Amrullah%20Saleh">Amrullah Saleh</a>; both reportedly flew to Tajikistan. Ghani fled Afghanistan without informing US officials or any of his top Lieutenants. He also did not inform most of the Afghan government officials regarding his intention to leave the country. Kabul's presidential palace, <a href="Arg%20%28Kabul%29">the Arg</a>, was evacuated by helicopters. Meanwhile, Taliban co-founder <a href="Abdul%20Ghani%20Baradar">Abdul Ghani Baradar</a> arrived at <a href="Hamid%20Karzai%20International%20Airport">Kabul Airport</a> to prepare the takeover of government. At 8:55 p.m. local time, the Taliban claimed that they had taken over the Arg, which had been vacated by President Ghani earlier that day. Allegedly, all other palace employees were ordered to leave after Ghani left. Reporters from <a href="Al%20Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> were later allowed into the Arg and interviewed Taliban militiamen. At approximately 9:12 p.m. local time, it was reported that the Taliban would soon declare the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a> from the Arg, returning to the official symbolism of the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Taliban government of 1996 to 2001</a>. At around 11:00 p.m. local time, Ghani posted on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> that he had fled in an attempt to avoid a bloody battle and that "the Taliban have won with the judgment of their swords and guns".

In the evening, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Afghanistan">National Museum of Afghanistan</a> posted a statement on Facebook stating "huge concern about safety of Museum's Artifacts and goods for Museum Employees". <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> mobile health teams in the city were placed on hold because of safety concerns, and the delivery of medical supplies via the airport was significantly impacted.

Section::::Impact on civilians.
The Taliban's advances alerted many Kabul residents. Some locals, <a href="Taliban%20treatment%20of%20women">especially women</a>, were fearful for the restoration of Taliban rule and reported feeling betrayed and abandoned by the Ghani government and NATO allies; a minority of residents celebrated the Taliban advance. <a href="Zarifa%20Ghafari">Zarifa Ghafari</a>, the former mayor of <a href="Maidan%20Shar">Maidan Shar</a> who was working with the defence ministry in Kabul, told media that "There is no one to help me or my family. I'm just sitting with them and my husband. And they will come for people like me and kill me. I can't leave my family. And anyway, where would I go?"

It was reported that sales of <a href="burqa">burqa</a>s (known as "chadaree" in Afghanistan) jumped in the days leading to the Taliban's arrival, with the price of one increasing from to as much as (approximately 0 to $37.25), in fear that the Taliban would re-impose it as mandatory on women and would target women who refused. One Kabul woman told "The Guardian" that female students had been evacuated from their university dormitories before the Taliban could reach them and that university-educated women across the city were hiding their diplomas. <a href="Khalida%20Popal">Khalida Popal</a>, former captain of the <a href="Afghanistan%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Afghanistan women's national football team</a>, advised the women's national team players to burn their uniforms to avoid reprisals. Shops in the city were noted to have begun painting over and removing advertisements featuring women, and public posters featuring women were vandalized. Residents reported a large increase in food prices. It was reported that a significant number of vendors in Kabul were attempting to liquidate their stocks in hopes of raising enough money to escape the country.

Concerns were quickly raised about the thousands of refugees who had fled Taliban advances elsewhere in the country and now found themselves stuck in Kabul.

Section::::Kabul Airport evacuations.
Since the Taliban had seized all border crossings, <a href="Hamid%20Karzai%20International%20Airport">Hamid Karzai International Airport</a> remained the only secure route out of Afghanistan for those seeking to escape. The streets of Kabul were gridlocked with residents rushing towards the airport, with some abandoning their cars to make their way on foot through the traffic. Residents who had worked with the government and international organisations reported destroying their IDs to avoid being targeted by the Taliban, and many of those fleeing for the airport took no possessions with them. Long queues were reported outside of the airport and foreign embassies, with residents waiting in the heat in the hopes of being able to secure visas or flights out of the country.

After the <a href="fall%20of%20Herat">fall of Herat</a> on 13 August, the US and UK announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops, respectively, to Kabul Airport in order to secure the <a href="airlift">airlift</a>ing of their nationals, embassy staff, and Afghan citizens who worked with coalition forces, out of the country. Between 14 August and 31 August 2021 (when the US military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan), <a href="2021%20evacuation%20from%20Afghanistan">the US and its coalition partners evacuated more than 123,000 people</a> from Afghanistan via airlifts from the <a href="Hamid%20Karzai%20International%20Airport">Hamid Karzai International Airport</a> in Kabul; the US military and its <a href="NATO">NATO</a> partners provided security for the airport and airfield. Evacuees included foreign diplomatic staff and military personnel, foreign civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans such as journalists and human rights activists. The airlift was the largest <a href="Non-combatant%20evacuation%20operation">non-combatant evacuation mission</a> in US military history, with US military personnel taking 79,000 civilians through the airport and out of Afghanistan over the 18-day mission. The Afghans who were permitted to leave were those with proper credentials; many held <a href="Special%20Immigrant%20Visa">Special Immigrant Visa</a>s or other US visas. The majority of Afghan applicants for US visas, such as those who had served as intepreters for US forces during the 20-year war, were left behind.

Those evacuated included about 6,000 Americans, the vast majority of whom were <a href="Dual%20citizenship">dual</a> US-Afghan citizens. The US government estimated that, at the time of the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan on 30 August 2021, there were "a small number of Americans, under 200 and likely closer to 100, who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave." The State Department had repeatedly urged Americans to leave Afghanistan since as early as March 2021, but some chose to remain in Afghanistan. Diplomatic efforts by the US to evacuate remaining Americans who wish to leave to country continued after the military withdrawal.

Following the collapse of Kabul, a handful of Afghan politicians, including the parliamentary speaker, left the country and travelled to Pakistan. <a href="Bismillah%20Khan%20Mohammadi">Bismillah Khan Mohammadi</a>, <a href="Sarwar%20Danish">Sarwar Danish</a>, <a href="Ahmad%20Zia%20Saraj">Ahmad Zia Saraj</a> also left Afghanistan.

Section::::Suicide bombing.
On 26 August <a href="2021%20Kabul%20airport%20attacks">an explosion</a> which resulted in a number of casualties took place outside Kabul Airport. Earlier that day an intelligence report indicated that a "very lethal terror attack" was likely to take place at the airport within a few hours. The <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant%20%E2%80%93%20Khorasan%20Province">Islamic State</a>'s Afghanistan affiliate (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack.According to reports, US reportedly gave Taliban the names of Americans and Afghan allies to evacuate.

A US drone strike aimed at presumed Islamic State members suspected of planning a suicide bombings at the Kabul airport killed a family of 10 civilians in an adjacent car, including 7 children and an employee of a US aid organization. On September 17 the Pentagon admitted the strike was a mistake.

Section::::Reactions.
Former Afghan president <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> pressed publicly for a peaceful transition of power, promising he would remain in Kabul with his daughters. Other figures closely associated with the US-backed Afghan government, including <a href="Gul%20Agha%20Sherzai">Gul Agha Sherzai</a>, the former governor of Nangahar province, congratulated Taliban on their victory.

The United States, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, India, and Sweden evacuated their embassies. Some countries like China, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Qatar said that they do not intend to shut down their embassies. Several governments, including Sweden, Germany, and Finland, announced that they would be suspending development aid to Afghanistan. Other countries, including those with no diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, have either started or hastened efforts to assist their citizens with leaving the country.

According to North Press, a Syrian news outlet, the morale of jihadist and extremist groups in regions such as Syria and Iraq, including <a href="Tahrir%20al-Sham">Tahrir al-Sham</a>, had risen dramatically following the fall of Kabul. Colin Clarke, research director at the <a href="Ali%20Soufan">Soufan Center</a> stated that he was "expecting a heavy wave of propaganda [from jihadist groups], especially with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>". The Taliban takeover was also applauded by the Palestinian militant group <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a> and some far-right supporters in North America and Europe.

British Prime Minister <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> blamed the United States for the Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan. <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20leaders%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">leader of the Soviet Union</a> who had overseen the <a href="Soviet%20withdrawal%20from%20Afghanistan">Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan</a> in 1988, argued that "NATO and the United States should have admitted failure earlier" and that the NATO campaign in Afghanistan was "a failed enterprise from the start" which was founded on "the exaggeration of a threat and poorly defined geopolitical ideas." Nobel laureate <a href="Malala%20Yousafzai">Malala Yousafzai</a>, who had survived a <a href="Tehrik-i-Taliban%20Pakistan">Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan</a> assassination attempt in Pakistan in 2012, stated that she was in "complete shock" and was "deeply worried about women, minorities and human rights advocates." Afghan author <a href="Khaled%20Hosseini">Khaled Hosseini</a> has also shared his concerns over the future of women's rights in Afghanistan, and expressed his hope that the Taliban would not return to the "violence and cruelty" of the 1990s. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> stated that "standing beside Afghan women in their struggle, and finding tools to pressure the Taliban and the political will to do so, is the least—the very least—the international community could do." <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> stated that the situation was "a tragedy that should have been foreseen and averted" and called for governments to "take every necessary measure to ensure the safe passage out of Afghanistan for all those at risk of being targeted by the Taliban".

The fall of Afghanistan also had a negative impact on <a href="United%20Kingdom%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">United Kingdom–United States</a> and <a href="United%20States%E2%80%93European%20Union%20relations">United States–European Union relations</a>, with the British government briefing media against the American government. In the UK, Foreign Secretary <a href="Dominic%20Raab">Dominic Raab</a> faced calls to resign after it was revealed he had gone on holiday to <a href="Greece">Greece</a> just prior to the fall and had refused attempts to contact him as developments occurred. The American government, led by President <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, also faced significant domestic criticism. Former American presidents <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, and <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, each of whom had overseen significant developments in the War in Afghanistan, also faced criticism. President Biden's approval rating dropped to 41% and only 26% of Americans said they support Biden' s handling of the situation in Afghanistan. Some <a href="GOP">Republicans</a>, including Senator <a href="Josh%20Hawley">Josh Hawley</a>, Congresswoman <a href="Marsha%20Blackburn">Marsha Blackburn</a>, and former Ambassador <a href="Nikki%20Haley">Nikki Haley</a>, called on Biden to resign. Some American <a href="white%20nationalists">white nationalists</a> and related extremists celebrated the Taliban takeover and American withdrawal on social media. White nationalist <a href="Nick%20Fuentes">Nick Fuentes</a> posted on the <a href="Telegram%20%28software%29">Telegram</a> messaging service, "The Taliban is a conservative, religious force, the US is godless and liberal. The defeat of the US government in Afghanistan is unequivocally a positive development." Some experts warned American extremists would use events in Afghanistan to push disinformation, organize and recruit.

Section::::Analysis.
Multiple commentators and public figures described the fall of Kabul and of the Islamic republic as a significant disaster and a failure for NATO. German politician <a href="Armin%20Laschet">Armin Laschet</a>, <a href="minister-president%20of%20North%20Rhine-Westphalia">minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia</a> and successor to Angela Merkel as <a href="CDU/CSU">CDU/CSU</a> leader, stated that it was "the biggest debacle that NATO has suffered since its creation and it's a change of era that we are confronted with". British parliamentary <a href="Foreign%20Affairs%20Select%20Committee">Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a> chairman <a href="Tom%20Tugendhat">Tom Tugendhat</a> stated that the collapse was "the biggest single policy disaster since <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez</a>". Journalist <a href="Nick%20Turse">Nick Turse</a> argued that "without a true reevaluation this time around, the US risks falling into well-worn patterns that may, one day, make the military debacles in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast</a> and Southwest Asia look terribly small".

Some, however, rejected claims of failure. Addressing the House of Commons on 18 August, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that the UK had joined "a mission to extirpate al-Qaeda in that country and to do whatever we could to stabilise Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew we would face and we succeeded in that core mission", additionally stating that "what is not true is to say the UK government was unprepared or did not foresee this".

The 45th president of the United States, <a href="Donald%20J.%20Trump">Donald J. Trump</a>, described the execution of the withdrawal of troops as the greatest "humiliation" in the history of his country and stated that he would have first taken out the American civilians and diplomats, then their Afghan collaborators, all the advanced equipment of the Afghan National Army donated by the US army and in last place take out the military, all this with the condition that the Taliban complied with the <a href="Doha%20Agreement%20%282020%29">Doha agreement</a>. The former president is also against the interventionist policy of his country, describing it as a "horrible decision" to have intervened in the Middle East and that it has not improved the situation in the last 20 years.

The Washington Post claimed that the Taliban seizure was "inextricably linked to Pakistan". According to the New York Times, "Afghan tribal leaders said that the Pakistani military waved a surge of new fighters across the border from sanctuaries inside Pakistan".

Section::::Causes.
Section::::Collapse of Afghan government and security forces.
<a href="US%20intelligence">US intelligence</a> assessments originally concluded Kabul would fall within months or weeks following withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, though the security situation rapidly deteriorated, leading President Joe Biden to concede on August 16 that "this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated".

Several Afghan officials placed the blame for the collapse at the feet of the Ghani government. Afghan National Reconciliation Council chairman <a href="Abdullah%20Abdullah">Abdullah Abdullah</a> denounced Ghani's fleeing of the country, stating that "The former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation. God should hold him accountable." General <a href="Bismillah%20Khan%20Mohammadi">Bismillah Khan Mohammadi</a>, former ANA <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> and Interim Minister of Defence, tweeted "They tied our hands from behind and sold the country. Curse Ghani and his gang." NATO Secretary General <a href="Jens%20Stoltenberg">Jens Stoltenberg</a> stated that "ultimately, the Afghan political leadership failed to stand up to the Taliban... This failure of the Afghan leadership led to the tragedy we are witnessing today."

The imminent collapse of the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Security%20Forces">Afghan National Security Forces</a> (ANSF), and their inability to withstand the Taliban offensive has also been the subject of focus. It has been argued that despite the US investing over $85 billion to train and equip Afghan security forces since 2001, the Afghan forces had proven to be woefully inept, inadequate and poorly-trained to counter the looming insurgency.

Section::::NATO withdrawal.
<a href="David%20E.%20Sanger">David E. Sanger</a>, a "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" correspondent, analyzed the decision to leave Afghanistan by Joe Biden, and consequently the manner of the fall of Kabul, as the result of four basic assumptions, or miscalculations: that there was enough time before the Afghan government collapsed for the US to withdraw, that the Afghan forces had "the same drive" to win as the Taliban did, that there was "a well-planned system for evacuating the embassy" and Afghans who had helped the US and their families, and that if the Taliban made it to Kabul, that there would be a "bloody block-by-block civil war" taking place in its streets.

On 22 August, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" reported that "President Joe Biden’s aides were 'too scared' to question him on key decisions made in the run-up to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, sources close to the administration have told The Telegraph."

Section::::Comparisons.
Section::::Egypt 1956.
In an article in "<a href="The%20Conversation%20%28website%29">The Conversation</a>", William Maley, an <a href="Emeritus">Emeritus</a> at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>, compared the fall of Kabul with the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> of 1956, stating that Biden had "failed the people of Afghanistan and tarnished US credibility around the world", stating that the United States "increasingly appears a fading power internationally". According to Maley, the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is due to Biden's inexperience in the field of foreign policy, Western lack of understanding of Afghan society, and the legitimization that the Taliban received with the Trump-lead <a href="Doha%20Agreement%20%282020%29">Doha agreement</a>. He concluded by quoting former British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, who said in 1940 that "our promissory notes are now rubbish on the market", stating that, as a result of its failures over Afghanistan, the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Joe%20Biden">Biden administration</a> is rapidly heading in a similar direction.

Section::::Cuba 1961.
Instead of Saigon, former American Defense Secretary <a href="Leon%20Panetta">Leon Panetta</a> compared the fall of Kabul to the failed <a href="Bay%20of%20Pigs%20Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a> of Cuba in 1961, saying that "President Kennedy took responsibility for what took place. I strongly recommend to President Biden that he take responsibility ... admit the mistakes that were made."

Section::::Vietnam 1975.
The events were compared by many commentators and the public to the <a href="Fall%20of%20Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a> at the end of <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> in April 1975. A month before the Taliban arrived in Kabul, American president <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> had rejected the comparison, stating that "the Taliban is not the <a href="People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam">North Vietnamese Army</a>... There's going to be no circumstance for you to see <a href="22%20Gia%20Long%20Street">people being lifted off the roof</a> of an <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20States%2C%20Kabul">embassy of the United States from Afghanistan</a>. It is not at all comparable."

Reporters argued that Biden's comments did not age well, as embassy staff burned documents and "helicopters were pictured hovering above the compound, shuttling diplomats to the airport" less than a month later. <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Lawrence%20Chambers">Larry Chambers</a>, who had given the order to push helicopters off the during <a href="Operation%20Frequent%20Wind">Operation Frequent Wind</a> to make way for more evacuee aircraft from Saigon to land, stated that "what is happening now is worse than what happened in Vietnam", elaborating "[In Vietnam] we tried to get out as many people who worked with us as we could... In Afghanistan, we are abandoning the folks who supported us while we were there."

On the day the Taliban entered Kabul, American secretary of state Blinken rejected the comparison to Saigon, stating on an ABC's "<a href="This%20Week%20%28American%20TV%20program%29">This Week</a>" interview that "this is manifestly not Saigon. We went into Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission in mind, and that was to deal with the people who attacked us on 9/11, and that mission has been successful."

Section::::Afghanistan 1992.
Ross Douthat of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" compared the <a href="Afghan%20Civil%20War%20%281989%E2%80%931992%29%23Militias%20fight%20in%20Kabul%20%2824%E2%80%9327%20April%29">1992 Fall of Kabul</a> with the fall in 2021 and remarked that the Soviet-backed government managed to survive for 3 years after the withdrawal of Soviet forces compared to the few months for the American-backed government. Zamir Kubalov, the Russian envoy for Afghanistan also remarked that the "regime created by the Americans tumbled down even before they left" in comparison to the <a href="Soviet%20withdrawal%20from%20Afghanistan">Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan</a>.

Section::::Iraq 2014.
<a href="Ibrahim%20al-Marashi">Ibrahim al-Marashi</a> of <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20San%20Marcos">California State University, San Marcos</a> compared it to the <a href="Northern%20Iraq%20offensive%20%28June%202014%29">2014 Northern Iraq offensive</a>, in which <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Daesh</a> overran large parts of Iraq and proclaimed a <a href="caliphate">caliphate</a>, arguing that the collapses were caused by the imposition of "rigid, hierarchical American military doctrine" on the Afghan and Iraqi militaries, that the Taliban and Daesh were more cohesive armed groups, and that the NATO-backed Afghan and Iraqi governments had "allowed networks of patronage and corruption to take root". The Iraqi government and army were equally plagued by structural corruption and unknown amount of <a href="ghost%20soldiers">ghost soldiers</a>.

Section::::Ukraine.
<a href="Security%20Council%20of%20Russia">Security Council of Russia</a> secretary <a href="Nikolai%20Patrushev">Nikolai Patrushev</a> compared the situation to <a href="Ukraine%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">Ukraine–United States relations</a>, stating that "a similar situation awaits supporters of the American choice in Ukraine". The collapse has led to Joe Biden receiving immense criticism, and has challenged Biden's <a href="policy">strategic policy</a> of the US pro-activeness in aiding its <a href="allies">allies</a>.

Section::::Taiwan.
State-run media in China compared the situation in Afghanistan to the <a href="Taiwan-United%20States%20relations">United States' relations with Taiwan</a>. It questioned the former's commitment to defend the latter if China decides to take control of <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, which it claims to be its province, by force.

Section::::Aftermath.
On 16 August, most of the city's streets had been deserted, save for those leading to the airport, with businesses shuttered and ANA security checkpoints unmanned. Taliban fighters, however, were sighted parading their flag and weapons and taking selfies by Kabul landmarks. Taliban soldiers were also sighted going door-to-door searching for Afghan government workers and human rights activists. In the days after the fall, some residents reported that the Taliban had re-imposed a ban on women leaving their homes without a male guardian and that multiple businesses in the city that had been run by women were shutting down. Local television stations began to censor foreign and entertainment broadcasts, while state-owned broadcasters stopped broadcasting almost all but Taliban statements and Islamic sermons. The Taliban also began removing women journalists from their positions.

On 17 August, the Taliban held their first official news conference in Kabul, with spokesman <a href="Zabiullah%20Mujahid">Zabihullah Mujahid</a> stating that the Taliban wished to "assure the international community, including the United States that nobody will be harmed in Afghanistan" and that "after consultations that are going to be completed very soon, we will be witnessing the formation of a strong Islamic and inclusive government." On 21 August, Taliban co-founder and political leader <a href="Abdul%20Ghani%20Baradar">Abdul Ghani Baradar</a> arrived in Kabul for the first time in over a decade as the Taliban began internal negotiations on how to govern the country.

In the evening of 18 August, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it had welcomed Ghani into the UAE on humanitarian grounds. On 19 August, Ghani released a video denying reports he had carried a large sum of money with him as he fled and that he was negotiating a return to Afghanistan. Other government, military or anti-Taliban officials also fled to either India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

In the days following the fall, American government agencies began erasing public articles and images featuring Afghan civilians from their websites, out of fear that the Taliban regime might use those websites to identify and target civilians for reprisals. The American government also announced that it would be freezing $9.5 billion worth of assets belonging to <a href="Da%20Afghanistan%20Bank">Da Afghanistan Bank</a>, the central Afghan bank, to prevent Taliban access to the funds. The <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> also announced that it would be denying the Taliban access to special drawing rights.

Several social media companies, including Facebook and <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, announced that they would continue to ban Taliban content from their platforms. Facebook also put in place a feature allowing Afghans to lock their accounts to prevent the Taliban from noting down their information. The Taliban have decried such bans, arguing that it infringes on their right to free speech. A surge in creation of new, pro-Taliban accounts was reported on Twitter, one of the few social media companies that have not banned the group, in the days after the fall.

Section::::Refugees.
Several commentators anticipated a surge in refugees fleeing the Taliban after the fall of Kabul and the Islamic Republic, with several governments announcing plans in the days following the fall to take in a number of refugees. After the capture of Kabul, more than 300,000 Afghan civilians who worked for the US were at risk of Taliban retaliation. 

A number of countries refused to grant asylum to Afghans who had been working as embassy guards as many of those guards had been technically employed as contractors. On 19 August, 125 guards of the <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20Kabul">Embassy of the United Kingdom, Kabul</a> were told by telephone they no longer had jobs and were ineligible for UK protection because they were employed through a contractor, GardaWorld, unlike guards at the US embassy who were evacuated. Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="Pekka%20Haavisto">Pekka Haavisto</a> stated that the Finnish embassy guards were "sub-contractors' sub-contractors" and could not be included on evacuation lists. The Australian government had initially announced the same for their embassy guards, but backtracked a day later.

Section::::Resistance.
Section::::Panjshir conflict.
With the fall of Kabul, former <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> members and other anti-Taliban forces based in <a href="Panjshir%20Valley">Panjshir</a>, led by <a href="Ahmad%20Massoud">Ahmad Massoud</a> and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh, became the primary organized resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Afghan embassy in Tajikistan replaced their presidential portrait of Ghani with one of Saleh, and submitted a request to <a href="Interpol">Interpol</a> to have arrest warrants issued for Ghani, along with his chief advisor Fazel Mahmood and National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, on charges of having stolen from the Afghan treasury. Massoud has stated his desire to negotiate with the Taliban.

Section::::Protests.
On 17 August, a small protest was held by several women in Kabul demanding equal rights for women, the first reported women's protest against the new regime. On 18 August, larger protests also attended by men emerged in three eastern Pashtun-dominated cities: <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a>, <a href="Khost">Khost</a>, and <a href="Asadabad%2C%20Afghanistan">Asadabad</a>, with protestors waving the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and taking down the Taliban flag. In Jalalabad, the Taliban opened fire, killing three and wounding over a dozen. On 19 August, demonstrations spread to various parts of Kabul, including one large protest near Kabul Airport where cars and people waved the flag of the republic, and another with over 200 people gathered near the presidential palace in Kabul before it was violently dispersed by the Taliban. Protests continued in Khost and Asadabad as well, with the Taliban using violence to disperse protests in both. In Asadabad, protests were reported as swelling to the hundreds.
